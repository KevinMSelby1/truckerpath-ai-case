"I have been using trucker path for many years, but in the past year it has not been working for me, every time I open the app it stays on for a few seconds and then closes, I have sent many emails with the apps. staff and I have not yet had the issue solved. I'm starting to realize that the trucker path staff could careless.",4
"update is garbage. first is when you pick a new place in your destination. it will reroute to default route and not the route chosen. Secondly, the truck stops, and distances are off. The last thing it glitches more, and i have uninstalled and reinstalled. I loved the app before, but now it almost is like a waste of money.",2
incorrect navigation - incorrect truck routing @ no zones,0
"Did not like TPath format, so I canceled . Don't seem to be canceled. How do I get my money back.",0
I've been trying to cancel this service for over a year and I keep getting charged 32.57 per month for diamond service. this company is in for a lawsuit if they don't stop charging me and regions me for at least 12 months.,0
disappointed immediately because to access the truck routes in map navigation you have to subscribe and pay $20-30 per month. not worth it for only occasional use. NO THANK YOU,4
this map is old out dated and trash,0
"The app won't let me do a monthly gold subscription because it starts with a free 7 day free trial. Since I've already done that subscription in the past w the free trial, now I can't get a monthly gold subscription at all. I couldn't care any less about the free 7 day trial. I just need the monthly subscription without being forced to get an annual subscription to get the gold perks. Big L Trucker Path",4
"The app works great. I am trying to buy the annual subscription for diamond, witch is supposed to be 249 a year, but in reality is asking for 369. How can I pay the amount advertised in the app for 249$ a year. Is there any way to pay the amount advertised for a year or I'd better forget about this app.",0
"7 day TRIAL IS a trick and will automatically subscribe you for one year, and you can't get out of it. (With Gold Version) Bloated with fuel advertising/ question pop-ups. Slow app compared to others, especially when ""looking for route"" loading must be server based because its slow. Very, very slim or no useful/ current road construction/ closed road data. *Random detour off, then on a good road that was unessasary. *Toll calculator is wrong by a lot. Reality= $50.90 (State website), app= $22",0
"NOT RECOMMEND!! Used to be a great app a few years ago. Q:1 how do I shut off all the unnecessary alert? ie: animal ahead, curve ahead ect.. all useless Q:2 what happened to the driver reviews? Places that had hundreds of reviews now show 2-10? Seems like the app wants to cater to businesses NOT the driver by allowing compaies to remove reviews and start advertising regardless of whether I have them selected or not. After yrs of the yearly subscriptions, We will not be re-upping anymore.",4
Don't use the fuel option it doesn't work and there just stealing your money for 24hrs! You can't call them or message them. My bank will know this is a fraud charge.,0
"Hi there Please add function where once you zoomed in or zoomed out the map as much as you wanted the map locks at the zoomed distance i miss a lot off turns because map won't stay at my zoomed in distance , the view is to far",0
I'm not a trucker stop showing it in my game I'm playing!!!,0
"NO PARKING UPDATE BUTTON on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE... fuel update yes, not truck parking update button",0
"I used to use this app years ago. The free version no longer finds truck routes, just car routes. There doesn't seem to be an option for providing updates on roads that are not for trucks. The trucks that come through my area are constantly getting stuck due to missdirection and I just found out this app was routing them.",1
Was working perfectly now not even the weigh stations or fuel shows,4
"Absolutely sucks, can't connect with my gmail account, UNBELIEVEABLE!!! I want to buy and they don't want to sell it to me. Terrible!!!!",0
Edit it's now march 1st 25 and the same issues are in the app and the price has gone up exponen No turn by turn while on call. have to back out of the trip to make changes. 3.5 out of 5 difficulty rating. tries to make you do turns on bridges and send you down roads that are not truck friendly. takes forever to load maps if they are in satellite view they keep saying that they are fixing the bugs but it doesn't happen burn the battery out of the phone in a couple hours all around dissatisfied.,0
By far the most dishonest and deceitful individual I've come across in my life time if the app is anything similar to the app designer it deserves less than the 1 star I was forced to oblige it with. Don't even waste your time time considering it take my word for it on this one 👎👎👎,1
I no longer use the app no way to cancel it and they refuse to help me cancel my subscription I'd honestly give it 0 stars if I could,3
TERRIBLE the map constantly freezes up and it's constantly rerouting. I have tried unistalling and reinstall app several times as well as force stop.,0
Not free.,0
This app is cloned . Please remove all devices from this app.,0
"Not, very bad",0
$30 a month!!!!! OUTRAGEOUS!,0
it cannot even get you through St Louis right way I had to Make u-turn on on little Street almost got in accident if you pay Gold they will constantly trick you to get Dimond which is 33.00 a month with gold you can only add 2 multiple stops and after you made them it wouldn't remove them and when you try to add more stops it will tell you to purchase Diamond membership that's big time BS,0
"Do not use this app, they take your money and disconnect you, they do not solve the problems you have, they also leave you talking alone in the chat and they tell you that your account expired almost 3 weeks ago and they do not let you use it because you have to pay again right now, I cannot use it because it is supposedly expired, I sent the payment receipt and they are reviewing it 4 days ago, they are not reliable",2
I have only notice recently that they have night mode/ dark mode behind a paywall. I could of sworn it wasn't at one point. Either way it trash to charge for color change of map. Like google map is free so u can drive at night for example. I work at night so when I stop for 30. I like to double check for parking but get blinded.,0
"the worst apo in the world, the most ordinary group of thieves. The navigation is buggy, there is no update, you have to be careful how you drive because it gives longer routes, to put it mildly terrible, and they charge like a pro. she changes routes by herself, you choose one, she herself goes back to another, horror",0
"This app is brutally bad. If you are in Canada don't use this terrible app. It's glitchy , lags bad, tells you very incorrect speed limits , tells you to make turns on roads that don't even exist. The truck icon spins sideways while you are driving straight like it has no idea in which way your driving. I would never use again if I was in a car let alone trucking",0
"GPS is garbage, better off paying for a truck gps",2
"After update it no longer works can't find it's own location takes wrong turns , canceling subscription, use hammer the app same thing works smooth and it's free",0
Quite often sends me on wrong route road with no trucks in North Carolina continually sending me on Route out of the way,0
To expensive,0
"Don't bother downloading the app, as it is a paywall trying to get truckers to pay more for the features it should have had as free, like the actual truck option is locked until you buy a overpriced subscription and much more, might aswell buy land tracker or any other app cause at least I'll get something worth my money",0
Was free. How greed does follow.,0
"Update, still keep hitting for it to start the route and still it refuses to do anything, device has signal. And Gmaps has no issue what so ever instantly mapping a route to where I want to go. Did devs even finish high-school what's going on?",0
"This app doesn't work,,,please close my account.... that's wacky.",3
"No matter how many times I click on my ad to refuse the installation of this app, it always downloads no matter how many times I hit the x. I don't know if it's a good app for people who like that sort of thing, but to me it's a hostile installer",2
Tried to send my truck under a 10' bridge at logan airport. To make a u-turn no.less. dangerous app if you don't know where you are or what you are doing. DO NOT recommend.,3
Can't get it to take my paymand google help said they were going to take care of it and still haven't and this has been a week,0
"Freeze on tablet, have restart for use. But freeze again when u close app and try use again. Useless for tablets",0
"Can you stop shering my all info to 3rd party, I always asked to callers where you get my number thay said Trucker Path",4
Waste of money,0
"If you want to have truck routing, you have to buy the gold package, other than that it will give you car routing, ttried it four different times for the same address, it's not optimized for trucks unless you buy the gold package. Period. It will route you like a four wheeler on holiday. Edit: just updated app, still not really using it, but keep it around.",0
It's Really Bad app App hiding weight Station HRS I'm not understand why ...... ?,0
It's not worth paying for. It's barely better than Google Maps. It has taken me onto unnecessary mountainous roads. It will take you onto truck restricted roads. It will have you exit a freeway just to get back on at the next entry. It has cost me time and money. It DOES make sure you don't go under low bridges. And it will ask you if a scalehouse is open or not when there isn't even a scale house there.,1
"I've been using it for years, but since the update, it keeps crashing on me every time I use the app. Fix it plz I love the app, but now i uninstall it cause of the bug..",4
Well this is not trucker app anymore it's truck stop app because this app let the truck stops only to update the diesel prices. Some truck stops lying about diesel prices on this app when you get there it's .50 + cents more per gallon . Before this app was good because I truck driver could update the price for the next trucker passing through Well good luck TP I'm about to uninstall you you're not good for any truck driver business.,2
Can't try without paying,0
"It's ok but finally got around to trying to get it to do night mode and that's a premium option, what a crock. Sorry driver I hope the bright daylight colors didn't ruin your night vision",0
I was wrongfully charged for subscription for this trucker path app for the year. I have tried so many times to get my refund but trucker path says refund will be issued by play store and play store says refund will be issued by the app developer. No one is issuing the refund.. It's a scam.,4
"Whoever made this app should be fired I pulled into a truck stop for my 34, because the app said I was alot closer to my destination while I was driving, and after I went into sleeper berth I checked the app again only to find out I was 185 miles further away from my destination than it originally said when I pulled into the truck stop. I'm going to be almost 3 hours late for my delivery now, and there's nothing I can do about it thanks alot.",0
"You are constantly inundated with truck routing, and truck GPS offers. Now all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky I'm getting load offers from the app. Don't even have an account on the app. Have asked several times to be removed from the email list, but the emails just keep on coming. Customer support absolutely SUCKS! This app is owned by the Chinese. Guess they don't understand English. No wonder it's all f'd up! Whatever you do, don't click on any of the icons to look. You'll regret it!",3
It's a lie it's only free for 7days then it's 20 and up a month,0
Too expensive,0
Weigh Stations status unavailable. Error message,4
"So far of all the apps I've used I seen this one covers most of what I'm looking for. You can get a lot of info from the remarks about each place, my fav is listing the exit numbers, and mile markers very very helpful. Updates it in December of 2024 and now it no longer allows me to see if parking is available or weigh stations are open or closed. Fix the last update.",4
Did I read this correctly? $250.00 per year?,0
This app is terribly glitchy. The map never selects what I wanted to select and the app kills any other app that I have in the background such as a music app or YouTube. Then when I go to restart my music this app resets itself again. Extremely frustrating!,0
It lags. Way too much. I can't even pick out a truck stop any more.,0
Keeping shutting down on my eld,0
Trying to cancel 7 day free trial subscription,4
Worst thing ever for the price . Save your points and get a Garmin or a rand anything but the overprice they want,0
Monthly payments just to change options 😒,0
A SERIOUS ROUTING DEFECT... IMMEDIATE ACTION NECESSARY! error We will get back to you. MF THIS GETS MARKED AS NO TRUCKS EVER IMMEDIATELY YOU INCOMPETENT IMBECILES. GOT IT!? APPARENTLY THIS HAPPENS 5X A MONTH AND THEY CAN'T GET THESE NAVAGATION SOFTWARE COMPANIES TO FIX THIS. GUESS WHAT MF'RS... IT HAPPENED TO ME... COST ME HUGE MONEY FOR 1 TURN. THIS BETTER GET FIXED BY DAYS END...,0
"Absolutely 1 star after recent update! They took away the ability to leave comments and reviews for weigh stations. No more ""no cc, no police, scale out, mobile scale only"" quick information we actually need! The community is what made you! Why would you want to restrict us?",2
This app is becoming unreliable. Within the last couple of weeks they have deleted several truck stops that have scales and parking. Why would you do that.,2
Newer version closes by itself; I am constantly opening itself!,0
"While helpful at times, this app has serious lag and lots of missing info. For the love of all things holy, please let all users opt out of the stupid chat rooms feature. I keep getting notifications about other drivers at this truck stop inviting me to the chat. Disabling the chat notifications in the chat room does not affect these push notifications.",0
🗑 🚮 🗑,0
How do I cancel my subscription??,3
"Make more options for regulation of sound! Quite annoying hear : -Keep left/right when you moving straight! When you really need to keep right or left it letting you know in last second! -Curve/rock/animals ahead every 15 min! (No need that at all!) -Weight station 50 miles ahaed! Make it 10 or 5 miles ahead notice, not 50! Add more options for optimization app! Fix that please, or this year will be last year purchasing your app for me. That voice update, worst ever!!!",0
Totally sucks,0
I have no idea about this I downloaded it and then it wanted money,0
Poor customer service had a billing issue they what to charge me twice,0
It hard cancel my subscription I've been trying,3
"The new update is horrible no more alert about 80% of weight stations , what happened it was great app but recent update is ridiculous plus the routing is also much much worse now takes you into residential neighborhood if there's even some type of construction, do NOT update they destroyed the app , how can I get older version ? Icannot stand the new version",1
"You guys need to fix this app. It's ridiculous. Google maps is free and works better than this thing. They'll charge us a ridiculous cost and then your app just glitches all the time. Be in the middle of a city at 80,000 lb and all the sudden your app starts glitching. Y'all need to fix this immediately",1
"Rest in peace, my friend. You were close to us, but you sold out. Thanks for the good times, and may the ground be soft under you. In short: they sold out. No more early warnings about weigh stations, and the routes have become terrible. For example, instead of just taking you straight ahead, it will reroute you through residential neighborhoods to another street in the most inconvenient and even illegal way. Why? Because there’s a weigh station there.",2
"Since latest update 11/16/24. Apparently actual truck stops have been deleted from this app. I can only assume it's because of blackmail. If the truck stop won't pay the blackmail to be put on the app. They get deleted. Case in point. T/A Near Hickory NC and Loves travel center near Marion NC. Both have been deleted from the app. Why, probably because of greed and politics. The owners of the app are probably still crying because Trump won the Election.",3
GPS is wrong wants u to pay to get the right directions BS,0
"Previously, when I clicked on the weight station icon, information about it was immediately displayed, but now when I click on the button, only its area pops up and to find out the information, I need to click again.",0
"Latest update annoying as ****, everything is an alert, it used to be just steep downhills and directions. Now tracks ahead has to tell me 3x, deer sign, watch road, curves etc. And it's all alerts or nothing. I do not need it telling me all this junk. I can't turn off all that without turning off the directions as well which is thr only thing I actually do need. I contacted customer support from app before posting review. Response was 'will submit feedback to developers'",3
"They censor the words ""smell"" and ""stink"" in reviews. Why? Because it be used as an insult? Might as well not allow reviews because literally anything can be as an insult",0
Taking payment without my permission,0
Horrible not worth the money.Decided on giving it a chance.sent me in wrong direction.Doesnt update if you go wrong.Google maps far excceeds this app.& its free simply plan your route on interstates or state...its easy... Delete & forget was a good idea but this aint that...This app under city congested traffic is useless specially if roads or highways close.Lags way to much to even consider it.,0
"the fact that everything is getting better for apple is very disappointing!! before that, I had an iPhone and there was a ""button"" on the left that shows all places on route ahead, with one touch (truckstops, rest areas, weight stations, etc.) very convenient. And there is no on Android! Why?? it is so difficult to add one function that is already on iOS to Android too. what kind of double standards??",0
"Update limitations on older devices create negative outcom for expirience users ,customers",0
Keep loosing gps,0
I liked the app until they removed the ability to quickly go to google map directions.,0
"The worst GPS for truckers ever made, no joke. If you're looking into or interested in completely ruining your career as a professional driver trucker, then you should get this horrible and useless app but If you care about your trucking job then you will do ANYTHING to stay away as far as you can from Trucker Path. Wrong speed limits always, worst routes with the most traffic every time, crashes constantly, will wrongly assume you're on another road and change directions and so much more. 0/10",4
Stupid map changed route without reason,0
"the latest update made the program just awful on the android platform. Previously, I clicked on the Wait Station icon in the right corner and immediately saw the Weight Station and its status: open or closed. Now, you need to double-click on the Weight Station icon to see its status. You have to take your eyes off the road longer. It's not safe. Fix it. Restore it to how it was.",3
"Not working, pls refund, trucker path team said, play store refund you",4
It's okay I guess. They really limit what you can do and lock all the features behind a pay wall. Want to add 10% to the timing on your route?! For the low price of $20+ per month we'll do that. No thanks I'll just do it in my head. Edit: oh nevermind. It's basically not functional at all unless you pay. I'll use Google maps and go back to my Garmin next week. This app is terrible and predatory.,1
Can't find anything,0
Fraud people . They never return your money . Fake promises. For your info it was purchased directly from you guys 👦 fake people,0
"Do not recommend for people that actually need information Trucker path refuses to update and add location for scales and portable scale common locations Last 1.5 yrs sent 30 emails, have email chain with their replies, followed their directions on emails and the in app add location. Sent real time info with live pictures But to this very day they have made any effort to correct or add the proper locations to their map So good luck if your counting on the. To have correct or accurate info",4
Say one word isn't a bad word when leaving reviews on the app for places and you suddenly will not see your reviews or comments on anything. Even if it's rated G. This app has more censorship than google,0
Trucker path keep posting the wrong fuel price at a fuel stop even after I change the price to the correct amount. I have screenshots showing.,4
Have to pay for everything now not fair to us driver's,0
I have canceled the Trucker path and still got charged. So please refund the money and stop charging me,4
"Loved app till this last update now its completely different to use. Please put it back the way it was I don't like the way it works at *UPDATE* 10/10/24 DO NOT pay for this app it is complete garbage, it gets worse with every update half the time it don't work at all just says recalculating or rerouting, changes routes on you sends thru downtown streets versus leaving you on interstate, don't show half the scales anymore",3
"Huge red flag... once subscribed to the no ads and premium features, YOU CANNOT UNSUBSCRIBE. the option to do so in the app fails every time and I just got charged for another month of service for an app that I don't use anymore. I am very displeased.",3
I don't like update when I press weigh station right in the corner he doesn't show me open or closed. I have necessary press to on map that's ridiculous 😕,2
"Didn't want this and Google hid this to when I was trying to download something else. This boarders on a scam. I search for what I want, stop trying to force your way into my selection process",0
Scammer,0
"I think someone should take a very close look at this app, developers, and possibly fund appropriations!! I have found several straight racist reviews from other users of the app, yet despite utilizing the report option the posts are not removed and helps perpetuates hatred while turning profits from those you are allowing to be ostracized !!!!!! Shamefull!!!",0
WHY DID THIS CHANGE? NOW IT WILL NOT WORK? FAH😬,0
"Trying to cancel subscription,I don't like the app",0
This app is horrible.,0
Can't install on a perfectly working older tablet,0
Keeps on crashing,0
To slow,0
"I loved this app until this last update. It's an app for truckers, why give us car routes and make truck drivers pay just to map out a trip. We can just use Google maps in that case and a truck gps.",1
"Still Garbage after selling it to more than likely a Chinese company, changed to Truckmap after these people forced update to app in order to use. Duck off",3
"Clumsy UI. Rerouting and adding stops never works properly. Can't control the pop ups that ask about parking and weight stations. Will try to force diamond membership. Just buy a brand name gps, they all have satellite now, and updates are free. This app is the worst.",4
"I can't update, I have 2.8 gb of available memory, and it tells me to delete some apps for it to install, why! Some help please.",0
"This is a giant waste of money. I bought it for truck parking availability. Not only is there ZERO data, they pretend the Pilot in Rice Hill Oregon does not exist. When you report the problem, a couple months go by, and they Fail to Fix it.",0
"It has a login with Google button but then still requires me to enter an email and password. It's 2024, I'm tired of making passwords, we have better ways - please implement them.",0
New update killed audio output. Not really useful now. When's the next update to fux.,1
"Not free, free trial. Uninstalling.",4
How to cancel? Useless,0
Charged my account for a full year I tried to get a refund and the support teams but absolutely useless. They responded to my email once and never replied again.,0
"What a convoluted POS this app is turning into. Jack of all trades, master of not a damned thing. Just buy a Garmin.",0
keep crashing on Fold 4. take 5 mins to locate,0
Seriously this app advertises a lot of cool stuff but then at the end they what to charge you for this. How come I just can't have regular navigation for a truck for free?,0
Cost way to much,0
"Paid app only, unless you want the trucker path for car routes only 🤷🏼‍♂️",4
I hate getting suckered into something that call it a trial and immediately charges you....then you have the audacity to tell me to reach out to trucker path knowing they are gonna tell me I have to reach out to google play...You want me to pretend that I havnt read the other reviews that said you have stolen from them as well....you are simply stealing and you don't have a conscience....just a matter of time before you're ordered to pay it back just all other companies who have done wrong.....,4
"This app never put me a truckers route, I do local driving and it would always take me to restricted roads for trucks. So i cancelled the app and was still charged. To this day this company is still trying to charge me, however they say they can not pull up an account on me. Scammers!!!!",0
It's not accurate and it gets confused All the time,0
"Terrible app, crashes all the time, do not recommend.",0
"Great app for truck scales and truck stops. Definitely NOT worth the price of $163.79 every six months. Frikin OUTRAGEOUS price. I used it alot and subscribed for a year. But I haven't needed since I got out of the truck at the end of 2022. I opened it to show a friend a couple days ago, and it socked my bank account instantly for another $164! Give me my money back!",2
Do not use. Terrible app.,0
Horrible app half the weight stations have disappeared of the map so moving to trucker guild same thing just better in my opinion rest areas ain't disappearing and less bugs,0
So now with a update on this app it doesn't let you update the status of the scales anymore. Guess they want you to pay in order for drivers to report if the scale is open or closed.,3
"Cancelling the subscription in the app does not cancel the subscription. You will be fraudulently charged. These people feign incompetence, but they are actually criminals. If I haven't deleted this, they haven't given me a refund for their fraudulent activities yet. Don't believe them when they say they want to make it better. They don't.",3
It says free trial. I signed up for it and it charged my account the subscription amount. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,4
"Canceled This service over a year and a 1/2 ago, and they keep still trying to take money from my account. I have tried contacting them several times cannot get through to anybody to make sure this gets canceled and stop charging my account for this trucker pass needs to give me a phone number I can call to make sure this happens.",0
I am switching back to DAT because can't seem to ever get anyone with in support on the phone I can't verify my dot # my email nothing to be able to book the loads I want #2 when you call it rings twice and younger a message noone is available with no option to leave a voicemail very poor customer service I would not even rate a 1 star ⭐ I have even emailed to have no response I run a company and I drive with other trucks iny fleet want better ratings then do better,0
Bad support,0
Company selectively scams people who don't want to subscribe to the service by implementing a broken cancellation sequence in the app and claims to be powerless to do anything about giving refunds. These people are criminals.,0
"Google says you have to get a refund from Trucker Path, Trucker Path says to get a refund from Google. A bunch of crooks are stealing your money. Always excuses why the app doesn’t work half of the time. I'll keep adding to my review. Hopefully, the people paid to respond to these critical reviews, damage control, take notice! How can you sell a broken app and get away with it consistently? I want my money back!",4
"Horrendously slow. It actually slows down the whole phone. I'm thinking whoever programmed this is spawning too many UI elements at once. It's to a point that wherever I touch it attempts to pull up info on that place, even if it in the middle of nowhere. This is just a light tap. Once that happens the entire phone freezes and I have to restart the system UI. I have a very new phone with the latest snapdragon too. And it also gets your clipboard automatically once the app opens. Spooky",0
This app used to be good. It led me to a port and now I'm stuck parked on a ship headed to France. When I get back I'm gonna have a word with yall.,3
"Someone tell me... why does the GPS get lost so much and reroute unnecessarily... this is very dangerous and can put us at risk, even with the CDL. It is not fair if I am paying for an app in which I have placed all my expectations. They ruin it.",0
"Started free trial downloaded the states I travel in, we don't do california first trip I go to check on and it sends me thru california I even put down 4 axle trailer, why route thru a state I didn't download??",4
"Be careful ! the app is very bad, It can take money twice, and no one is responsible for it, the refund doesn't work.",0
This used to be my Go-to app for truck parking app. Forced to update and now I can't use it. Used to be able to select what I wanted all on one map. I refuse to search each brand one page at a time. I can use Google maps for that. Uninstalling,1
I paid for this and it takes me down roads. Aren't there? It's not up-to-date to the newest map. It takes me down residential streets and last night. It took me under a low bridge. That I hit trust in the app. It. 's got all my dimensions inside the app.So I should be able to clear this bridge.Hell no.So now I get to contact truckers path and find out who's gonna pay for my trailer,0
I am not paying just to use this app for trucks,2
"7-day trial, then $149 almost impossible to get through the customer service to cancel subscription in time, and get a refund. Then, subscription, not even on the email account I subscribed on . Buyer beware . When they tell you to go to the subscription page after you finally find it and click vew transaction to apply for a refund . There is no such link there on the page. Unbelievable . So now to social media to slam them there. 149$ no refund and 2 hours of my time so far ..",0
"Not as good anymore, gps gets confused when going through road construction, keeps saying recalculating until you close the app and turn it back on after you get through the construction zone. Can't give a rating unless you don't mind having stars in place of a non-cruss word that's if it even gets posted. Sort of woke and I'm not going to reply back if this truckers path wants me to.",0
I pay to use the app not too big of a deal however I'm getting quite frustrated with the fact I'll be driving down the highway and out of nowhere the app will minimize down into a picture in picture view and take me to my home screen on my phone. Sometimes it does it over and over again and sometimes it does it once an hour either way it always manages to do it at the worst possible time,2
"This App: ""I'm called 'Trucker Path'!"" Also this app: ""Pay for the Truck Routing!""",4
Will not let you unsubscribe,0
I want to cancel and I am unable to I've been charge for months don't do this unless u know and have the time to deal with this internet confusion really It never did anything good and I thought it was canceled like almost a year ago but I find my self chasing dumb things I've tried out but didn't look at the fine print be careful,0
"Had to use other map finder with this one just to make sure it didn't lead me into streets trucks SHOULD NOT GO OR BE ! After paying $126.00 for it & after 1 months & put in a few bad spots, don't recommend it because the cost is not worth it. Lead me to street that didn't exist and some parking spots that was not parking spots or spots not for trucks. If I have to use 2 mapping systems then it's not worth the money. Tried canceling as it say you can for refund but they will not refund 😒",0
Tried to sign up for the 7 day trial and the app charged my credit card for the full month. Beware,0
"Bad, bought it for using in truck. It is always lost signal GPS. I didn't like it. When in 1 month I ask to return my money. They refused. I'm disappointed.",0
I unsubscribed and still charging my card,0
"Annoying voice. Accidentally bought this and decided to try it, drive from Ohio to CT and it was not the greatest got me lost twice and the guidance voice is extremely annoying sounds like a little kid talking to you. Wish I didn't waste the 120 for 6 months probably won't use this ever again",0
"I would give this awesome application 5 stars without any hesitation, but i wrote customer service, and i have been ignored. It's no good",0
They charged me before the free trial was up and it was supposed to be $12.50 a month. I was supposed to have a 7 day free trial. Not 158.00. Not what happened at all. It also took me out of my way unnecessarily.,4
They expect you to have a monthly subscription for dark mode eff of,0
I am trying to update this app but its not getting update.,3
Have tried canceling app 4 seperate times with customer service so i didnt get a charge i didnt want after free trial. I dont use the app enough so i dont want to be charged for it. I have had to CANCEL/LOCK my card connected to this to avoid these fraudulent charges since its STILL NOT CANCELED. I would not recommend this to anyone. Nothing but a headache and waste of time.,0
I refuse to pay for services for any app.,0
"Scam. Do not input debit card info, use an empty visa giftcard. DO NOT ENTER CARD INFO. Youve been warned.",0
Every time I update they take something away!!!! The latest update made the background DARK & The information up top (while driving) is set in a Dark background. Which just blurs everything together! ( Before. The update the background was a lighter color (WHICH WAS MORE PLEASEANT TO VIEW WHILE DRIIVING) & The information up top will set behind a blue setting . ( Making a DISTINCT CONTRAST between map and Information up top!!) EVERY UPDATE...has made things worse! IM GONE!!,3
To expensive,0
Wanted to buy the service for a month was billed 6 months service almost 200 dollars and now i cant get a refund. I feel like i was scammed.,0
Cancelled this the same day and they billed me again anyway and now claims I don't have a account what a jokep,0
I can't pull up the app it says there's a bug is something going on with it I like using it I haven't had a problem with it until 2 weeks ago,0
"Had to cancel my subscription, because the app won't let me sign in on my phone",4
I'm trying to cancel app I have payed but locked out for days,0
"This works but it there is kinks BAD, they need to fix the technical support... it's always a hassle dealing with this app.",0
"How are you going to be claiming that You're a truck friendly app, but then you require payment for truck friendly routes for planning. I've been using this app for many years now and it's just gone downhill.",1
"Takes your money without service. If I could give it a zero, I would!",0
Routed me through illegal truck area. Nearly crashed as result. Dangerous and unsafe,0
Don't use it.,0
Newest update hasn't downloaded,0
In Canada. I downloaded my city. Expected to get truck friend routes with weight restrictions. I entered some addresses and it showed similar addresses in US cities and businesses in my city. Hoped it would be a solution for issues with Google navigation lately.,0
Horrible customer service,0
Trucker path want let me unsubscibe. It just taking my money and I don't need the app anymore,2
Never works,0
"It's strange that the apps yearly price continues to go up without any updates improving the truck routing and the user interface never gets fixed. On top of that, you continue to get spammed with ads for their fuel discounts and load board. At this point just buy a Garmin or Rand McNally and you'll have saved money in only two years.",0
"Was a terrible app with some functionality. But...they completely redeemed themselves by making it completely useless. ""Truck GPS"" is insulting at this point. Why would anyone pay for for an app that literally leads you into disastrous situations? When I sent them updates for their routes so it didn't happen to another driver, they responded that they couldn't fix it because it was based on Google Maps! I get that, but why am I paying you?! 😒",3
💥Update: Definitely not renewing my subscription. They raised the membership price too $150 a year now for the basic 🤑🤣✌️ No thanks not worth it truckerpath. There's other cheaper apps. Anyone else hate the new update. Like why zoom out the map everytime route is edited and the current location button keeps zooming to beginning of route and then is so delayed! 🤦🏻‍♂️😠,1
It was supposed to be free trial but it billed me $128 for 6 months! I used it one time and it took me the wrong direction in Joplin..luckily i knew where i was going! I am jumping through hoops to get my $128 back! Big time pain!,4
Update: Ended up paying into October for a year. Here it is May 30 and account doesnt work. Go to check and it looks likenmy account was cancelled. Nice scam guys. Too damn expensive. When I first signed up there was a monthly payment option for like $5.99 a month. All of a sudden it's almost $130. Guess I'll have to try to find another app. Go back to a monthly subscription rate than I think you'll find more people subscribing.,0
"Downloaded it, used it through the ""free"" trial period, which wasn't all that great! Tried canceling, they tell me I have to go through Google services to do that ha ha that's a joke in it's self! Now someone keeps trying to charge my account repeatedly for over $200 and I have yet to find the way to make it stop. So now I'm going to inform my bank of the fraudulent charge attempts and go from there. Definitely not worth it at all. Save yourself the headache, time and money, do not get this app!",4
"SUCKS!!! KEEPS TAKING ME OUT OF HIGHWAYS TO SEND ME ON SMALL TINNY ROUTES, UNPAVED ROADS AND ROAD CLOSEDS!!! REALLY??? NOT WORTH TO PAY SETTING ARE TO BE ON. HIGHWAYS SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG ON MY SETTINGS...NEGATIVE STARS..",0
"App and website buggy and broken. Can't even create a trip without it crashing. Website constantly says the map and dispatch links are locked and I don't have permission. I paid for the Diamond membership and am the super admin, how can I not have permission? Moving on to find something else. All I wanted was a decent truck route planner, but I can't even do that Basic function on this app.",4
"the up dated version is not working properly 😒😡app still navigation not any good doing really silly Unnecessary, navigating call of route. Paid subscription for many years now. This needs to get fixed guys",0
"Update: 05/25/24 App is still broken, I can maybe get one decent trip out of it before the app breaks. A new update got pushed to my phone this week and now the app has been rendered useless. It doesn't even know where I am and is constantly chirping at me ""route recalculation"" while I'm driving. I've tried deleting storage and cache and reinstalling app but it doesn't help. Google maps works just fine, so the issue can't be my 7a. This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed ASAP.",1
"Buggy, error filled, unreliable, slow routes, no traffic workaround",0
"The more I use it, the less I like it. IT GLITCHES ALL THE TIME AND VERY INCONSISTENT IN GENERAL. BUYING A SUBSCRIPTION FOR A YEAR WAS A BAD DECISION!!! IF YOU NEED GOOD RELIABLE NAVIGATION FOR TRUCK LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE.",0
Buy a real gps this app sucks it will reroute you and screw your day up. It stays confused reroutes constantly words cannot describe the hatred I have for an app that you pay money for that works as lousy as this service I hate truckers path I hate truckers path I hate truckers path,0
"This app shoild be banned. It allows crimimals to stalk you and harass you. Its a serious threat to your load securuty, promotes censorship ad racism. It also gives your employer tools to harass you. These are not good people. The developers must be canadian. Theyve been taking money ftom me for a coupke of years, canceled the service but continues to steal momey ftom my credit card. If you are a professional, do not use this app. I bet boeing uses this app",2
Every time when they release update the application glitches and buggy.,0
"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE, THERE IS NO WAY TO CANCEL!!! THE APP TAKES YOUR CREDIT CARD DIRECTLY AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY WAS TO DISCONTINUE SERVICE. THEY ARE NOT USING PLAY STORE SUBSCRIPTION LIKE MOST OTHER APPS. the actual app is mediocre for truck gps but not great.",2
"constant unnecessary recommendations, it is impossible to determine my location, it is impossible to start a route, knocks out, and also asks for money for use, I do not recommend! No, i subscribe gold plan, and everything I have described applies to gold plan. Still do not recommend.",0
This people are Rip Offs..they pay you a 💩$25 after the 3rd hr...while every body else pay $40 plus after 2hrs of detention..Always trying to beat us over our head.. Sickening👎👎✌️✌️,0
The link to reset your password will not load. They basically scammed me out of money.,0
"I use trucker path all the time and it usually works great. However, it alfo suggests making u-turns which semi trucks CANNOT legally do in most circumstances. Please modify the routing to reflect this.",4
"Use it all the time, but putting the night mode behind the $15 a month subscription is ridiculous. There's no reason that feature, which reduces eye strain, thus making driving safer, should be a part of the basic $10 subscription, let alone gold membership. Corporate America finally infected an otherwise decent app. Greed. Pure and simple.",0
"dear developers. please fix the application. it does not work with a connected external GPS antenna and the selected application for transmitting GPS data through the developer menu. My tablet doesn't have a build in gps module so I have to use this scheme. Other apps like Google maps works fine, your just doesn't...",1
has been messing up since the update,0
"Navigation is BAD. Don't pay for this. It will reroute just because you stopped at a red light, or no damn reason at all, and has twice in one week sent me down non-truck routes! DO NOT USE THIS TO ROUTE WITH A TRAILER!!!!",0
"This was an app is awesome, helped me a lot of time. But lately became not that good. And after update has lots of bugs.",0
Please increase satellite speed loading. Curser to small on tab s8 plus Add a few more options for the cursor. Great job with ADS. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. Reinstalled the app several times hoping? for the satellite to increase speed and loading. 5G it doesn't get any better Fix the apk 🙏,0
having all kinds of glitches after new update. every address I use to put in now says there isn't any such address and wants me to add a new place,1
Search function non operational on Samsung galaxy tabblet,0
"App won't detect my location. Whe I enter a Destination, the app puts that location as my current location",4
The satellite map needs to load much faster it should be more optimized for the phone Update weigh stations locations Map cursor should have a few more icons not just one truck Overall speed in loading needs to be increased buy a lot,4
"Took away city and town names. Half the parking is RV lots/parks. Same with so-called truck stops. About half are not truck friendly. Don't they have their own app? Can't search Walmart or specific stops without exiting the app. I choose a route, it reroutes partway. I'm exploring different apps.",2
"I'm tired of these updates. Every update comes with some bags. Now, all scripts are size 20 or more when I start driving. I can't even see the road when driving. What's wrong with you guys? Don't update the new version if it ruins the app. Please 😩",1
"NO WAY TO INCREASE TEXT SIZE WITHIN THE NAVIGATION SCREEN. ADJUSTING PHONE FONT DOES NOT AFFECT IT. These last few app updates have ruined this app. Not renewing my subscription after it expires. The information markers are tiny on the navigation screen. ETA & Time left at the bottom are extremely small. Exit numbers in top right are in readable. I reinstalled the app no help. I chatted with ""customer support"" even less help. Basically said yeah deal with it. Gone way down hill.",0
Thought I had a free trial and would b notified b4 I was charged. Not true. My account was charged 119. Want a refund and can't seem to find out how to get it.,4
Rest areas are a mess. A high school is listed as a rest area.,0
Junk app hard to read and understand,0
got charged 130 bucks that I never agreed to pay or start a subscription for this app and now magically they can't refund my money and Google play services say they can't either so thanks for stealing 130 bucks...,0
Don't use this app. They stealing your money and you phone battery will dry so fast,2
"This app is trying to take money from users in different ways, after a few months they start trying to limit the functions of the app; how to put limited stops etc. Don't be such Scammers!!!!!!! I'm going to delete the membership and buy a Garmin, it's cheaper in the long term !!..",0
Save your money. Not accurate at all.,0
"Would like to see an option that blends turnpike and avoid tolls, for instance, using ohio toll roads but avoiding the most expensive toll road (PA) New update is bad it has the right address but tries to direct me somewhere 6 states away somehow..",1
"Horrible experience!! So many times, I ended up in a residential area where a truck is not supposed to go. The parking spaces are never correct. I would not recommend this app to anyone driving a semi. It's better to just use Google maps, and that's not even for trucks. Nothing but issues, and I paid the subscription for months.",1
This app is junk . I've had it They keep charging and yet they get not fixing it . Its ripoff,0
Sound doesn't work. Doesn't notify. Pretty much a display you have to watch the whole time. No longer worth the money. I'll give you guys a week and then I'm moving to something else like Truck Smarter or Hammer. Your advantage isn't all that much after this update. Other than lowering the volume of my music.,0
FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!..👎🏿🚫,0
"I added in dot pullouts several times,they either don't get added in or gets removed if it's added in. I've notified trucker path several times updated 4-6-24 still can't ad in weight stations,I complain to trucker path and what ever fix they promise, NEVER happens ,beginning to think app not worth the time,will be looking for new app that works.",4
"Everytime the app updates it stops working on my phone. I pay for it yearly. Last update it wouldn't work for a month. Update afer it, it didn't work for 17 days. They just updated it again and now it DONT WORK AGAIN. when I need the app the most ot doesn't work! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS APP! Going on another month of it not working ! App still dont work. My emails are ignored. Charged for another year and app still not working. App still dont work after a month of the ""fixing it"" .",3
Not for truckers any more.,0
This was a good app and then you started charging and it's definitely not worth the money not even close,3
Unregulated advertisements illegal functions of the app pop-ups misdirection false information all kinds of stuff I deleted it,0
With all the changes that have happened to this app it went from 5 start to 1 star. No longer need this what has become trash.,0
Should be free,0
Whole trip it couldn't find my route. Kept recalculating. Also maps are too cluttered,0
Be careful they mKe it seem like they are going to charge you 20.99 but they charge you for 6 months. Very deceitful. And good luck trying to get your money back. If the app would of worked I would of been okay with it and ate the charge but the app is garbage. The app was offline when u needed it the most.,0
Overpriced junk,0
The battery issue has done better but after a major update some time in 2023 the routes have more often been sketchy and is no longer my prefered gps. Google maps would of been better on last route.,1
What the hell happened to gasoline and desil prices? That was the only reason I used trucker path! You guys have gone down hill really quick!,4
"I've tried to cancel this subscription numerous times they still keep charging, bout to help them out with that thievery",3
App doesn't work not able to cancel my subscription to it. It's a scam,3
A very bad application.Sometimes I can't run a route for 30 minutes. Clearly not worth the money,0
"Just awful! It always requires very powerful internet connection, for this reason I have to use Google maps! It's rediculous, because I pay 20$ every month for this trucker path! I have good internet, but it's not good enough for trucker path, and for this reason I'm going to stop pay for this service and just use Google maps",1
"You are staying at one star until you give me an option to turn the fuel deals off, it's so hard to read the actual price with it scratched out and tiny, I don't want to see the deal price. fix it then you can go back up to 5 stars.",0
"Free to download and free to use are 2 different actions. If it's a paid service, then I may as well invest in a stand alone GPS. I have other apps that can tell me where the fuel is discounted and where to park. And that's a free service.",0
The bugs are getting on my last nerve.,0
New update doesn't show all truck stops. Please fix it.,1
Nope. Not happening. Not paying for an app. Find out for yourself. I'd rather buy a Rand McNally GPS.,0
"The one star is as per my experience, I'm not saying it's the worst app or something like that. As per my experience, I downloaded it to find the truck route and what happened as below: 1: Praise location doesn't work. 2: Either it's only for the West Coast or Midwest but can't find the route in New York. 3: It's a paid version. The amount is a bit high, and then it's worth it. 4: Over all experience, inconvenient, never helpful. 5: Search Bar can't even find the address, which is 3 miles away",4
Not recommend,0
Bad service.. beaware of no refund policy,0
I am so angry right now so I clicked the free trial and then I was going to do the $20 per month after the free trial right know they charged me $119 the very second I click subscribe do not subscribe do not even try I am so angry,4
It costs $99 a month. Wish this was mentioned in description BEFORE I wasted time downloading this 💩 DELETING 🖕,0
I don't like the voice and the routes are not precise,0
Did not authorize money being taken out would like to be contacted today,0
Really bad lag. I have great unlimited service.,0
"Doesn't want to work on my Google Pixel Pro 7 anymore, keeps saying can't find route",0
This app only gets worse by the day. Truly trash. Edit: still abysmally bad. But now they won't show you where truck stops are.,2
THIS NEW UPDATE SUCKS! I've had it for over 2 years and have loved this app and service always. This new update shows wrong calculated time for route and arrival. Very annoying,1
"They say it's 7 day free trial, but still, they charge you right away $164 for first month. This app is big scam!",4
Crashes all the time. Used to run in the background now it doesn't need to constantly restart it. Please fix immediately,0
Gps is NOT accurate. Said I was 6miles away from my current location. Also while using the app for directions it would Grits an freez up. Causing me to get lost on roads that SHOULD NOT BE USED AS TRUCK ROUTS.,1
This application is horrible. It never works right. I had it on two different devices and it was never the same route. This week was the final time I'll use it. It says that 295 north in New York are no truck routes and sends you through the city on a no truck route. I highly recommend finding a different service to use. If it isn't saying can't find a route it's taking you the wrong route.,4
It's a joke....,0
"I never made an account, and I have been charged 158$ and have not been able to get a refund.",0
Be blinded or pay ! That's right pay top dollar to use night mode. Automatic fucx off ! Talk about a con !,0
Charged me both the annual and monthly subscriptions and won't refund me.,0
I have ti constantly close the app and restart it to get it to work,0
"The app doesn't work with any route that I enter. It always displays the same error, ""route cannot be found."". I reached out to support and asked for a refund and they haven't replied about my request for a refund in a week.",3
"I'm disgusted with the experience. I want to try a 7-Day trial, but ended subscribed for a year WHICH WAS NOT THE GOAL!!! I tried to cancel it but it still didn't return the payment and says that I'm signed up for the year. I tried to use the app and I absolutely do not like how it functions. In trucking industry offline mode is an essential option. This app does not have it.",2
Be aware they call you and try to recruit you.,0
"Since the update a few days ago, i can only run 1 route before the app goes blind. Meaning, after i finish a route and try to program a new route, no route can be found. Says it's having trouble connecting to Internet. Only solution is to restart my phone. Then it works fine. Trying to uninstall\reinstall rn. Love the icons on the map screen that show the next truck stop, test area, weigh station. Should make the background color of the icon red, orange, or green to tell the parking availability",2
"I've been using it since early 2021, had no issues even paying for it, now it's worthless garbage that I tell people to avoid using. It was perfect when it was simple and easy to use, it has useful information and single button press options. Now you have to write a dissertation just to put in stops or remove them, then it won't track movement properly and tries to send you the wrong way. Quit trying to fix what wasn't broken, you already had the perfect app for what it is, then you destroyed it",0
Yhis app sucks easey to subscribe hard to cancell subsctiption very difficult to navigate app thry get billi g information then u cant undo the billing i hate this app,0
The new update is terrible. It's so buggy!! I can't even use the app anymore it won't load any destination and just keeps saying can't find a way there. And if it does load half way through driving it'll bug out and start trying to take me out of route to get back on route.,2
This app still has so many bugs and glitches since the last update. It's borderline unusable. Really glad I pay money for this garbage,0
New update does not recognize my location when I try to enter new route. I constantly reinstalling the app every time when need to put in a new route. Galaxy S23 Ultra,1
This is a peace of sh###t. I can't believe I paid for this. I want my money back. Since the new update nothing works. I depend on sh##t for my work.,1
Updating my review. Now the app is having trouble finding routes. I have a Samsung s23 ultra if that helps any. I deleted the app and reinstalled it nowbi can't even log into my account. No code is being sent to my verified phone number on file and no email is being sent so that I can even log in. Please do better I love this app.,4
"Aside from the normal truck gps gripes, navigation is pretty good. My biggest complaint is the app is using too many resources on my phone. The battery gets super hot, and the charger can't keep up. UPDATE: Battery issue is still glaringly obvious. App was recently updated, but the fact this issue still exists is absurd. DO NOT USE UNTIL ISSUE IS FIXED!!",2
Bs app nothing useful not a big difference with Google maps. Payment options are real robbery. Subscription scam.,1
Route not found,0
"Fuel price was wrong, not up to date, I drove an hour and a half to a truck stop that was 40 cents more then what it showed on this app when I saw other smaller truck stop along the way cheaper thinking this was the best lowest price, awful!",0
This app sucks after the last update. I set the setting to show only the pilot. This application shows everything on the screen including other gas stations and parking lots. So that you understand there are hundreds of points among which it is impossible to find the ones you need. Shame on the developer for such an application. Shame that they charge so much money for such a bad app.,0
Dont work dosent let me do the route,0
"App won't show pickup or delivery routes, and I placed several reports, and my app and services still don't work 😑!!! I want a full refund, $250 for this ??? I have had to buy a Diesel Garmin.",4
You cannot find anywhere to cancel your account. When you contact support they say they can't help you because it's Google play stores problem. Sounds like a lawsuit if I'm charged again. I would rate 0 stars but that's not an option.,0
They ask too much money for monthly subscriptions.,0
"After the new update my app doesn't work anymore, it keeps saying it can't find a route when I type in an address 😡 now the app is useless should be given a year subscription free or refunded after the issue is resolved.",3
This app worked two whole days for me then left me STUCK afterwards!!!I need trucker path to end my subscription asap!!!I was charged one hundred and something dollars for 3 days of usage!!!Please end my subscription Please end my subscription!!!! PLEASE END MY SUBSCRIPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬,4
"Used to be great. Last update broke everything. It tried to send my in a bunch of ""no trucks"" and useless detours, fortunately I knew the route and I ignored it. I will not be renewing my subscription.",3
I would take a free version with ads that actually worked than this mess.,0
"After The update,the app doesn't want work for me Anymore,Keep saying ""Could not find route "" . Does anybody pls know what is going on ?",3
"Each update makes the app (Trucker Path) worse. Now the app even can't find a simple route and shows it can't find the start point, The app has all the permissions it needs.",4
Use to be a great app. I do a lot of driving in NYC so had no problem paying the $99 for the subscription. Now it doesn't give me any routes which really can mess me up. Already emailed about getting a refund. Let's see what happens,4
"I've heard good things about this app, but unfortunately, I can't use it. The app crashes constantly. I've updated the app and tried several other fixes I've found online; but for the money you pay, these kinds of things shouldn't be an issue.",2
Truck routes need to pay for service,4
This app has stolen 267.80 out of my account and im still trying to get it back.. i have uninstalled google is saying trucker path has to refund trucker path is saying Google has to refund no one will contact me email or phone ... this is TRASH... STAY AWAY... i want my money back !!!#########I didn't do a purchase did a trial and cancelled it and trucker path still stole my money out of my account.. this app is trash you all better stay away from it ... google maps is better than this trash....,4
I don't get offering a 7 day free trial then attempting to charge my card before the trial starts. Red flag. I'll stick with Co-Pilot.,4
Pure garbage,0
"Every time I navigate my route, it says, ""No route could be found"" every single time. The only way I can get it to work is if I restart my phone.",0
App is getting worse not better. Keeps loosing its self and recalculate. Gets very annoying listening to it say recalculating when you are on the right road and it is off gallivanting,0
"App was glitching (now I find out it's a problem with the app update), so I uninstalled it. Now it will not let me install the app back on my phone! What the heck! So it is currently a useless app. I used to use this another. Is it ever going to be fixed?",3
"I loved this app and recommended it, but since they updated it, it took me down a small road and It almost had me in a bind. Also in the same trip road was closed and it would not reroute until I stopped and closed it out then restarted the app and I had full service. I do not pay this kind of money to have these issues. I drive a semi not a car update sucks.",0
"What the hell you did to this map, take it back to the previous version I'm canceling my subscription!!!!!!!!!!",0
App constantly freezes up at critical times. Fix this issue and I'll gladly resubscribe,0
This is not free for truckers. Like everyone one else hosing truckers over for subscriptions. What a crock of bullshtein,0
I have to report a problem pretty much every time before it can find a route. Horrible app,0
App keeps not working,3
I was mislead by the free trial. My original ap went down so I tried this one to get home. Then my original GPS gaines back function. I go to cancel this trucker path. Im already debited for one day. No refund issued since March. It's almost New Year.,4
Stupid up all the time crashes,0
Junk. Tested it on my first route. A known daily route. This app leads you to a well known 12 ft overpass. Useless.,0
dosnt work most of the time and its extremely overpriced,0
Horrible customer service. They stole a year payment from me instead of a month. I wouldn't recommend this app for anyone.,0
Just cancelled my subscription. App was great at first then wouldn't load routes. Tried to get tech support to help with the problem but just same ignorant responses. My subscription runs out on July 7th 2024 and the company refuses to give me a refund after paying for the full year. This app is junk and will only take your money.,0
"Very poor,Hate this app",0
"I use to like this app, until it routed me on a road that had a low bridge clearance of 12'4"". it's a good thing it was 1 in the morning and I was able to do a u turn. That's what I get for being lazy and thinking a truckers app would take me on the safest route possible.",0
"I have canceled my subscription multiple times, and they keep trying to charge me. DO NOT EVER GIVE THIS APP YOUR BANK INFORMATION",0
"Consitantly takes me on route not large enough for fit a smart car down, especially if you miss an exit! It will take you on every windy, small town, 180degree u-turn route imageinable! Be extremely careful if using this app.",1
"Do some kind of update, this ep works terribly.",0
"Regularly puts me on truck restricted routes. I haul construction equipment so it's necessary from time to time, but even when there's a clear cut highway path to my destination it will tell me to take a tour of a local golf course, or something of the like. Not worth 15 bucks a month, when Google maps does the exact same function. They should make a trucker path app for people who drive commercial vehicles, instead of cars. Might be worth the money if they catered to their target demographic.",1
Very stuped. Dont recommt,0
"I’ve been using truckers' path for 2 yrs now. There have always been issues, but I have overcome them. Ever since the update, the app has been absolute garbage!! The location description does not show accuracy anymore, the zoom doesn’t respond immediately. Rerouting numerous times and telling you to get off the interstate just to get back on is extremely frustrating!! I’m fed up with paying for something that doesn’t work as advertised. I will be looking for other options.",3
Right now the app refuses to load a route for me. Cant find where I need to go. So I gotta use an atlas. This was supposed to be convenient but it's doing the opposite.,0
"A trucker friendly gps app that requires payment for the number one thing that truckers need while on the road. I'm sorry, what clown world are we in? That is ridiculous, along with the prices. It's absolutely insane.",0
"They are lying, they are not free",0
Very bad,0
Constantly freezes,0
Evey update this app gets the worst the map bugs get... with good internet connection the app keeps saying no internet connection. Also this map loves to change your route with out you knowing. Been using this app for 2 years now I'm about done with it..,3
Try to route me a highway where you can't take hazmat.. I went through the settings and set the truck up show that I had hazmat and it still routed me over a highway that doesn't allow for it. When I realized it was trying to do that I tried to edit the route but it would only let me select one of two options.. even tho the simple solution was to start with the one and even with the other I was unable to edit it... No better than Google maps.. not worth 24 a month...,1
Not worth $30 when it has me routed in circles. The routes I get are the longest and it has me exit when there's a traffic jam then has me enter back on the highway lol. There are some good features but not worth $30 a month... App getting worse. Keeps rerouting me and wants to send me through gated fences 😂,0
Worse app ever. You can send in all the restricted roads you want and nothing will be updated. You have better luck with Garmin and randmcnally. I've sent in over 15 route restricted roads and to go back months later to catch myself about to get hung up on a road I'm not to be on with a semi. You can send these people the proper routes but nothing will change. They just want your money not to do updates your paying for. Save yourself the headache and money go buy a trusted GPS system for semi's,0
This app has a basically become unusable with the new updates.,0
"Keep having problems for the cost of this app ,doesn't load directions quick enough when entering road way from truckstop, turn left get going and its saying u turn, now the voice prompted directions are not working I chatted with system no help just Uninstall and reinstall omg 😳",3
Can't see truck route without paying for membership 😕,4
Not free as described,0
"For the amount that you're having me pay for a yearly subscription, why doesn't your navigation work? What's the point of charging me for a product that doesn't do what it's supposed to do? Roads are missing, and it can't acquire a signal despite having full recption of 5G UC. My review will change once this major issue is resolved.",0
"Almost everything is behind a paywall with constant annoying reminders. No night mode until you pay, RIP to my retinas.",0
Never used it. As soon as I opened it they had upsell upsell upsell upsell upsell.... screw that I need info not a sales pitch,0
"Not worth paying for in my opinion. Every day I have to reinstall the app because it won't tell me what town or state that I'm in, and that's the only way to correct it. I've contacted customer service about this multiple times and got nothing. Now on top of that the GPS will tell me to make the opposite turns of what's showing and tell me to take different exits. The voice automation is very incorrect and doesn't fallow the actual navigation. Don't give the opinion to say more whenever you can'",4
I got charger for something I don't use.,0
"Been using trucker path for nearly four years and then recently after an update, All I get is errors and nothing works the way it used to. Such a shame because it instrumental. In driving.",4
"Taken away my 5 stars to 1, so slow any more, to many advertisements and every thing shows error now when I need to see if the weight station is open or truck stops parking. Used to be a great app, I'll find another app that can do better I guess",4
"Just updated. Now every location won't show details. Just ""Error Happened"".",0
"Save your money, this app is trash.",0
"Was good, but now ???? I have reported many times that the voice guide will tell you to go left but map route turns right. Interstate exit numbers are incorrect.",0
"Free trial, thwn 20 bucks a month. Might be worth it for truckers, but not if tou are living in the vebicle",4
I was just wanted to check that how is app is working. Before to subscribe it they were saying that you can cancel your subscription any time but I m trying to unsubscribe it from last 15 days but its not working.,3
Cancel because the service sucks when you want your refund 😒,0
I can't see if it took my credit card information.i seemed to be locked out.i can't get any information on this problem I don't want to be charged twice.,0
"App was great when I was OTR, haven't been for 3 months, don't have app on my phone, and you've still charged me $32 a month after I've tried to unsubscribe twice.",0
"What did you do to the app? You're trip planning is not even getting the right routing, makes us go in tons of no trucks and you charge at least 4 times what it worth. Map with something else, that price is a scam. no improvement in over 10 years. update: keep sending me in NO TRUCKS!!! DO NOT USE AS TRUCK GPS!!!! Google maps does a better job!",2
Does not work right wastes of money,0
The permissions are getting way out of hand. Too invasive. Like WAY too invasive. App is starting to look like spyware.,0
Got notification that if I don't update the app with the newest update (10/20/23) I would be locked out of my account. So I did it. Now when I try to open any locations on the map it just says error happened and gives no info. Tried restarting my phone. Same thing.,3
I know that there is fuel within 1/4mi of my location but app not showing. Also scale within 10 miles but doesn't show. Also truck parking near here and doesn't show.Useless ap for the state of Delaware. Would have to drive at least 30 mi out of my way just to come back if I depend on this ap. NOT PROBLEM WITH AP PROBLEM WITH YOU NOT GIVING INFO EXCEPT SUPPORTING COMPANIES,0
"Terrible customer service...long story short, signed up for 7 day trial, thought was 29.99, instead was 149.99. Tried to cancel right away through Trucker Path support, they told me to contact Google Play for refund. Google had me resubmit the request 8 times over 40 days, then no refund and they told me to go through Trucker Path again. NOT happy to be out 150 bucks and never activated the app.",4
App seems to want to send you the longest way around to anywhere. Doesn't help at all,0
Horrible navigation,0
"New updates don't show up some of weigh stations info, even hidden from map",4
"This review is coming from my Husband because he already left a good review when he first got the app a year ago. Then After the new update down loaded, data consumption has went up over 6x from what I was using on a 11hr drive day. Would be nice to have a Truckers Path app that didn't use 8gb a day to navigate. Not sure what changed to cause the data usage to skyrocket but would like for it to be looked into and corrected.",1
Pay to play,0
Worthless !,0
I tried to sign up for 7 day free trial and it immediately charged my account $150. And now I can't figure out how to cancel the subscription to get my money back,3
"This app is ok, but it's been telling me the wrong exit number, but the right exit crazy. It really needs an update",0
"Doesn't always show all the weigh stations. Constantly have to uninstall then reinstall the app to get it to work...for a second, then back to the same bs.",4
Far to persistent for paid version. So many discrepancies that I can't trust it,0
Sucks these days,0
"Awful experience. Paid for 6 months in advance. Didn't like app at all. Still trying to get my refund. Every customer support employee checks my account, promises me to solve my problem, and disappears.",0
"I wanted a month to month subscription, they instead charged ne for the entire year. And won't give me a refund. Scam, be careful !!!",0
Have to uninstall it many times before it works right,0
"I have paid for the semi annual subscription of over 100$ several times, contacted customer service several times and over years maybe logged on a handful of times and each time never access the diamond features I paid for that are not cheap even after logging in, contacting customer service or any other time. I would choose something else because you won't get a refund or your issue fixed no matter how much you spend or show you don't use.",0
This app sucks!! Try and do a trip plan with distances................I dare you,0
"Had to do a new review it's unreliable it crashes when you absolutely need it, I'm getting an error message saying no data, make sure you check your route before you hit go because it can and will give you horrible directions and I pay a premium for this BS, avoid at all costs.",0
It said the app is for free but when you download it and try to use it they try to charge you. They are charging you!,0
I paid for the subscription. It is not worth the money they charge. Add at least two to three hours to an extended trip. It is slow quite began and nowhere near what trucker Garmin has got going on. I thought I'd try to save myself the money and all I did is bought myself a headache. With this app I'm very disappointed. It has come a long way. But they still got a very very long way to go.,0
You weren't supposed to charge me refund my $130 I saw it on my bank account,0
"Canceled subscription. Navigation started routing back in the wrong direction whenever I stopped, why? Tried to take me down dead end roads, private/gated roads, roads not suitable for semis, over weight limited bridges, 100 mile/2 hour detours? Would regularly tell me to make u-turns, told me to turn left when was suppose to turn right? Rest area locations inaccurate. The truck entrance is usually spot on and it's a great tool for finding parking. It could use some work on usability.",0
"I tried the free trial, it charged me 15$ a month after and it wasn't worth it in the free trial. Within 3 hours after it charged me I canceled and requested refund , and they refused and said they'll just unsubscribe be , so I got stuck with a month of service for an app that I won't use and isn't worth it . Buyer beware",4
"This is garbage. I just started using this app and it is completely worthless. First it'll not tell you about road construction and road closures. You find out when you follow its directions and are staring at the ""closed road"" sign. Second, it'll change your set path on you without telling you it is rerouting to what I assume is a shorter route, yet may not be a route for a 75 ft long semi trailer. It got me lost on mountains that NO SEMI TRUCK COMBO belongs on. Third, give 5 mile turn alerts!!",1
scam,0
DOT/CVSE HAVE HACKED THE APP AND ARE POSTING FALSE REPORTS. APP IS USELESS,2
"How the hell are you going to have a gps app made for trucking but not actually give truck routes for trucks unless you pay for it. Literally cannot even use the truck route option, only the car route options. You might as well go buy a nice Garmin, specifically made for commercial trucks for the price of the membership",4
"It was great for the 2 years I've been using it, but the recent update has made it absolutely horrible! I've had I crash constantly and freeze every time I add a route point. It just took 5 minutes to restart a trip from my tip history! Considering I pay $30 a month for this, it shouldn't be happening.",2
"Works terrible, constantly freezes",0
After last update the satellite button is disappeared. I can't use app on my Android tablet in album mode. Fix it please!,2
have to pay 20$ a month to use im not a truck driver sooooooooooo NO 👎 whatever,2
They are willing to take your payments but when you get ahold of them to cancel and get a refund they do not and will not pay you back... worst truck gps app I have used. Will not recommend to anyone,2
"This app is worthless!! Even paid for a full year and on 2 trios since I paid full price hasn't been correct at all. I'm going to try to get my money back but probably won't get it, but I will make sure I pass on to other truckers that it is a waste of TIME & MONEY!!!And it almost cost me my job. THANKS",1
Still trying to pull funds from my account for subscription that I canceled prior to the 7 days. Not getting any help,0
It keep shutting off,0
"Only places that are sponsored... Found it to be political, hence useless",0
I paid for premium but still getting pop up adds. Very annoying when I'm driving and trying to find a place to stop!!! Very concluded app. I hate but not there isn't much else Frequently overheats and freezes up my entire phone. The directions are absolutely pointless unless you're close. I really wish there was an alternative to this.,0
Not accurate do not get this app. Doesn't show small business places only big brand business.,3
Why are you serving me ads for your services after I've already overpaid for a subscription? Stop asking me to use your fuel discount and load brokering services.,0
"I want a refund, not happy with app",0
$25 a month for this POS??? I even had a hard time trying to sign up and it wouldn't connect to my Paypal what a joke!!,0
Subscription required to use,0
$20/month,0
"Signed up for the free trial and was immediately billed for over $100. I cancelled the trial within the week but have gotten no refund. App support said to request the refund through Google, and Google denied my request.",4
Frustrating,0
This app is so glitchy anytime I leave my map and try to resume everything is frozen I have to turn the phone off and back on sometimes that doesn't even work half the gas stations I passed aren't even on it and they've been there for years it does help some when it does work but had the app for a long time and they only keep going up in the price and it seems like the more they do that the more problems it has what a waste of money,0
"You get $ 17.00 per month for the person you need to develop the app. Look at google maps and improve yourself. the map needs to zoom in because the roads are not clear,",1
"It's a POS. It's useless if you don't subscribe. So u decide to try the ""gold"" version which is also useless. Anyways u sign up for the 7 day trial and they don't notify you they're going to auto subscribe you, they just charge you the full 100 Dollars for a year which u didn't want and won't use bc frankly you are better off using the sun as a compass to find your way. The app is slow and drains your battery. It doesn't catch road closures that Maps will catch.",0
You know.i spend 15 dollars a month for 3years.wich equals out to 540usd for this app not to work reliably is ridiculous!.the least u could do is lower the price for this trash app it needs to be fixed,0
Wow you gotta pay so dumb,0
"Can't change truck type (i drive a straight crane truck). Can't choose which icons to show on map, so it's littered with thing i find useless. Search results don't show local first. I'm west coast Canada, and search will show an address across the country before an identical srett number/name before closer ones. I paid for a single month of Gold membership, and i feel I've wasted my money.",0
I have tried to use it many times but never worked for me. I wouldn't recommend it.,0
They advertise monthly payments for a 1 year subscription. No contact information. Took full year payment after 1 week trial. Been trying for months to get a refund. This is ridiculous. App wasn't even good.,0
"App this days are totally broken, fix issues with navigation mfkers!",0
Fix the bugs please it close the app by self Most of the time doesn't show upcoming rest area sometime doesn't show anything I should clear the present address and give the address to the app again 2 3 times day,0
"They have no technical service, they are not in this country. I had this service for years. On my traveler and it had dark mode I travel at night, When my tabut quit on me. I bought a new one. Lost thousands of points. And they won't put Dark mode on my. New tablet New tablet, unless? Unless I upgrade. The only reason they got one stars It's because there are no minus five stars!",0
Ooooooo I need to cancel this account from my phone and forget my bad experiences with this 0oooooo,0
Drains my battery and maps are out of date,0
How do I unsubscribe,0
"I have been using this app ever since day one. In recent years it has become to tiresome to use it and I only use it for truck stop. It isn't about the ads or asking me to subscribe, when it takes 10 minutes to load the map when you have 5G and you pass the truck stop you are looking for is ridiculous. Not worth using anymore.",0
"App glitches and freezes has taken me into residential areas where if I had followed the app I would've taken out power lines had to back up almost 1/8 of a mile on one trip to turn around I unsubscribed but it didn't let me. Love the rest area, truck stops and parking aspect but the way its been glitching and freezing has me completely frustrated.",2
"I didn't like the app, difficult to get started",0
"It keeps freezing up.. I Uninstalled it and installed it again, no change.. If we are will to pay that much for it, we shouldn't have any problems. Fix it or point us to another app.. I wouldn't give it a star but it wouldn't let me post this unless I did...smh.",0
"Aggravating, Definitely not the most user friendly app. You really gotta do a lot of digging to figure out how to use it. And the little tips and tricks such as changing from my from miles to kilometers. Also if you have a lot of Stop, the app will crash. As soon as you hit start navigating, they eliminate lots of the features and settings. That would be nice to use during your drive. you have to quit navigation and cancel your trip in order to go back and use the features you need.",0
This app is completely perfect. If you want an app that overheats your phone to the point that it actually causes damage to the phone and then the phone starts glitching because of the app and is insanely hot to touch the directions from it are okay. Sometimes the map doesn't want to work at all and sometimes it does. It just depends on what the app is feeling like that day. I really believe that the app needs a lot more work. $30 a month for this service is insanely ridiculous!,0
I paid for 6 months but then my wife was pregnant and I took time off work. Upon returnkng I asked them to credit me a few months since I already paid so much but they just tell me to go to google play for refund. I cant even find it in my google play history Also it is ridiculously overpriced at $30 a month or $360 a year ( you can buy a whole truck gps for that much and use it for years ),2
"Stupid app made me click on it by accident and it started downloading, apparently it downloaded so I am able to write this review. Disgusting. Remove apps like this for forcing people who aren't even interested to accidentally download so they can steal your information.",0
"If you want to use this app for a trucking, don't waste your time you have to pay for it to give you truck routes.",1
Rip off. 10 bucks a month and still asks for more money for a barely functional laggy app.,0
"I cancelled during my trial period, but was still charged for membership.",0
Not free as advertised.,0
"Free app is o ly for standard auto navigation, actual truck commercial navigation requires a plan.",0
Scam. Unnecessary trash with zero quality of customer care.,0
NOT GREAT,0
this app is the big lier in the app the diesel $3 I fueled my truck and went inside to get my receipt they charged me $4.69 per gallon. this was the second time happened with me. this app is garbage and trash. please never trust this app.,0
I could be sitting at a truck stop put in the GPS where I need to go drive 20 minutes down the road and the map still be showing I'm at the truck stop.... I will have to turn my phone off just to get it back working again,0
"SCAM ALERT Tried it for ONE day, of the 7 day free trial and was billed $150 even though i canceled the trial THE SAME DAY. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. The routes itgives ya are the same as all the free truck route apps. Edit: reply to developer. I DID, and y'all denied the claim!",4
Scam,0
"Beware if you put your card information, they make it look nice but the app sucks and if you keep your card info they will charge you $100 for this dumbass app",0
Have to pay otherwise it works like any other car gps.,0
This application is starting to get more and more frustrating by the day. All it does is glitches and freezes just about every time I use it. Then glitches and stays Frozen in a place that I'm not even in. It also takes forever to get back to normal. Can you please fix this,0
Has costed me time and money by randomly changing selected routes while traveling on the originally selected route. If you add more than one stop like truck stops or other POIs it wants to route you back to the previous stop when completing a second or 3rd stop. You're charging 10 dollars a month to use truck routing on an app that is intended for truck drivers and ZERO issues have been fixed in the well over a year I've used and paid for this app.,2
Stopped my phone from charging,0
Wildly expensive!!!!! Buy a truck nav.,0
"This app is the worst. Get the same, or better from Hammer",0
I thought this was a good app. But you all charged me 129.29 for what kind of subscription. This is f up.,3
Was very useful app. It no longer shows scale status along your route,0
Free for cars but trucks have to pay,0
"Over priced for what it does, waze is 100x better and it's free, unfortunately waze isn't a trucking gps or I would use that in a heartbeat, most business don't show up when you search for them so you have to put the address in and make sure it's putting you in the right place, they can't even get the speed limits correct on some highways and the worst part, even though you have a subscription, you still get blasted with an ad to upgrade to a 30 dollar plan every time you open the app 🤡🌍",2
garbage app takes me into places I should absolutely never be with a semi truck . It has done it numerous times,0
"Don't even attempt to try out their truck routing tool! I did with the ""free 7 day trial"" and was immediately charged $150 for 6 months. To top it off the routing tool doesn't work! I attempted multiple different locations along my route and stops last night and only got the ""loading"". Contacted their support and was basically told I'm out of luck getting my money back unless Google decides to refund it 🤬",0
"This app is infuriating. My Google maps doesn't offer truck routes so I downloaded this app specifically for that purpose. I open it up and it gives me a standard car route, but blocks the truck route behind a pay wall right off the bat....making the only reason I downloaded this app pointless. On top of that, the gps is barely usable making this app a useless version of an app I already have.",4
"Devs don't seem to mind that the app is being used to help human traffickers, never mind all the blatant racism, that's the least of it.",3
Charged me $159.98 on a Friday evening after bank is closed. Contacted customer service said sorry contact Google. Ripping off an over the road driver is very poor judgment.,0
"It's an awful app. They gave focused in the part of the app that has a load bord ,and they completely drop the ball on the Trucking GPS. I would never use it again.",0
"This is no better than Google maps. They want you to pay for premium to get the ""truck"" upgrade",0
Google maps has way better recognition of what I'm searching. Have a way to only do Canada or the states. Im not going to Florida Im just trying to get across town,1
Was charged on the Google play store the full amount of a Gold membership. I only attemted to use the 7 day free trial now I'm out $107 dollars and left to dispute the charge with my credit card alone. Trucker Path says contact Google and dispute the charge with my credit card so I have. Google says this purchase doesn't meet there standards for a refund. I'm getting no help here outside the standard responses.,4
"Paid for the app and was very disappointed. This app has tried sending me down non truck routes and down streets with weight limits below that of even a day cab. Today when it attempted to repeatedly send me down streets with low bridges I had enough and immediately cancelled my subscription. You may as well use Google maps, you'd probably get the same results.",1
To expensive there is free app,0
Oh pay me. Pay me. I just want a decent map to avoid low bridge and know where the fuel is at.,0
Not free,0
"1st day out in my semi, with 53ft trailer. Tried to send me under a low bridge. Had to drive 2 miles in reverse down a windy country road back to the highway with police escort. The app was my wife's idea lol. still love her tho.",0
"Support disconnected before solverd problem the ignore Don't working HOS optimization , but on subscription opton active, same problem with offline maps",0
"App was fine till last update. Now getting weigh station status from everywhere except where I need it. Not interested in your routing. Plenty of routing apps out there. Stick to basic info.(Scale location and status, truck stop and rest stop info. Kill the rest.",2
Clicked on 7 day free trial was charged $161 for subscription. I canceled subscription right away. I was giving the run around. They must have needed the money more than me. Trucker path ripped me off.,4
I'm sure a five-year-old could design a better app unfortunately this is one of the few apps if not the only have that is cooled toward truck drivers that is not get dedicated towards one brand... It takes 5 to 15 minutes just to get it to work on an Android or an iPhone it continuously freezes continuously crashes I would not recommend this to any truck driver paid version is the same way I do not recommend this app to anybody,2
Recent update broke the app. Used to work fine but now I can't login so I can't route. Literally leaving me no choice but to change what routing tools I use.,2
I have been trying to cancel my subscription account but this stupid app will not allow me to cancel.,3
I downloaded this app just to find out you have to pay if you actually want it to show you truck routes so you might as well just use Google maps,1
I could not get this to work and Cancel my subscription and then my account was over. Drafted so I was charged $35 and how can Union that none of their phone number? You can read anybody at this is one of the worst apps. I've ever used. Do you can't even cancel it?,3
They say try for a week. And cancel but they don't show. You?,0
these people will over charge you. I just wanted a truck navigation and was charged for their premium package. so be careful with this group,0
It won't let me cancel my free subscription without charging me first,4
Quit putting folk's information out.,0
In order to use this for trucking you have to pay a monthly fee and it is too expensive. It is cheaper to buy a GPS unit outright that can do the same this app can do. Don't waste your hard earned money!,3
Are you kiddin me. That price,0
"Broken & overpriced. The app cannot find locations half the time Which doesn't make sense because when you zoom in on the map there's a labeled marker to that location. But you cant tap it to select it, you can't enter the address manually, if you search it cant find it. When navigating, sometimes it'll work like Google maps. Most its an unmoving overview with glitched hud. If you get lucky and it works, you cant change apps or lock the screen cuz you'll have to restart. For $30/month! Insane",1
Too much teenage nonsense,0
It is really starting to upset me that I leave a review and am notified that I received a response but then when I click on it I see my review has been removed. Paid for it got a new phone and after signing into my paid account I'm told to resign up for the 7-Day trial to pay again. I literally had just paid for the app not even 2 weeks. Please stop deleting my comment. It always takes 1+ hrs navigation time when using this vs other navi systems!,0
"This app has been going downhill for a while, but the new ads that pop up every time you open the app are making it even worse. Idgaf about saving money on fuel or load boards. I am tired of dismissing them. When I get on your app, I'm there for a reason. That reason is not to flip thru your catalog of pop-up ads.",2
Super intrusive and irritating ads.,0
"I wasn't having too many issues prior to this last update in which it started getting a little slow in bringing up directions to a location. But a few days ago while working on a trip going west, I was getting ready to take my 30 when my directions flipped and started telling me to double back east from the direction I just came. The map no longer comes up as fast as it used to and it tells me that it cannot find the places I'm searching for. I don't have the free service...it's paid.",0
"Very bad experience. Used the free trial, cancelled same day I downloaded and was still charged 2 months fees. No refund, no explanation. They dont have a phone number and are challenging to comtact. Bad app",4
"Today was the 2nd time in the last week the app took me to a no truck road. Both times I had to run an hour off my clock to get back on track. Not to mention the super tight roads I had to go down. If your going to be a ""truck"" GPS you should at least make sure you don't route down no truck roads with 13T limits.",2
"Didn't work good in NYC, besides suggesting to take a parkway route it ask me to make a illegal right turn and the next 2 days I got charged 149usd , save your money and but a legit truck GPS",2
It's about 3 km off it's destination,0
"I tried it again. And it could not find a valid route from Hesston Kansas to Mora Minnesota. Are you damn well kidding me!!! Unloaded it the app and it won't be back guaranteed, waste of time",1
trash,0
"Warning!!!! DO NOT UPGRADE TO A MEMBERSHIP. It is easy to upgrade, but very difficult or not even possible to cancel your membership. THIS APP IS A SCAM!!! You've been warned.",0
"So, I am currently paying for a subscription, but for some reason, I can't log in. This app belongs in the trash can, it use to be good, maybe 4 years ago om currently looking for a better app",0
So full of Glitches Makes it unusable,0
The volume speaking function is not working even after the update only Spanish works and they can't fix the issue,0
I've tried twice to get a refund of a mistake i made over the APP & PHONE but they took the $$ out anyway without giving me a refund while the $$ was still pending from my account. Time to get my bank involved again,0
Pay ?! Stick it where the sun doesn't shine! Un installing,0
"This app use to be really good, but since the latest update, it doesn't work so well now. It freezes up and it freezes up my phone so I have to pull over off the side of the road to restart my phone this knows not bode well for you truckopath (UPDATE) I thought this a good app. I digress. This POTrash took me 200 miles off course after setting a multi stop course. I knew when it had me leave I35 south towrad Dallas . But i assuned it was going to take me to route 69 south. But it kept going E",3
Too costly,0
BE VERY CAREFUL WITH TRIAL AND YES I AM SHOUTING TO WARN OTHERS. THE CANCEL BUTTON DOES NOT WORK ON THE APP AND GOOGLE PLAY WILL CHARGE YOU. I AM OUT OF POCKET $127 AND DID NOT WANT THE APP. TRUCKER PATH SAYS ITS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM AND CONTACT GOOGLE PAY. THEY REFUSE TO REIMBURSE THE CHARGE SO BE VERY WARY IS ALL I CAN SAY!! I WILL BE TELLING EVERYBODY IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY ABOUT THIS SCAM UNTIL IT IS RESOLVED!,4
"Never cared for it but the one I had is no more. And the last few days ZERO truck stops show up on the app. I'll just make my own! I know Javascript, php, google dynamic apps.",2
Keeps freezing up I done,0
First trip using this. Route from Shreveport to PFG Batesville 506 hwy 35 N Batesville MS 38606. Why in God's name is this app routing me down RAILROAD TRACKS!!!! unacceptable,0
"It's been 5 months since I left this review, and they still haven't fixed the food tab. I'm currently at the Love's in Lenoir City, TN and Trucker Path says there's a Taco John's here.....but there's not a Taco John's, it's McDonald's. This app is horrible Every update is worse. They got rid of the food tab so now we can't see what restaurants are at the truck stops. This app is quickly becoming useless.",2
Downloaded app under the impression I was signing up for 7 day trial at least thats what I thought I was confirming. I was charged a $164 for a 6 month subscription. Reached out to customer service who said I have to apply for a refund thru Google which was denied my request. Not impressed 😕,0
"This ap is a great idea, but doesn't have proper or adequate support.",0
"The app was terrible before the update and even worse after. It freezes mid navigation without me touching anything, so I have to pull over and restart the app. Most occasions the app will completely glitch and not begin the navigation, just shows me sitting, so I have to reset it a few times. I can't add a stop without it freezing. I mentioned all of this to the support team before the update, and they told me, ""You had a chance to use the free trial."" It sounds like a broker owns the app..",4
"Used to love this app. Now not so much. It tried to send me on routes not meant trucks regularly (i.e. state routes with length restrictions, neighborhoods unnecessarily). Will change your route mid trip on occasion. Can't use it ""effectively"" anymore unless you pay. Save your money.",4
Slow very slow,0
This app is a joke. I was heading to Detroit from Indiana. If I were to follow the navigation I think I would have ended up I Florida. Switched back to Google maps. I tried this app about a year ago on the free trial. I quit it after the first day. I guess I should have learned my lesson then.,4
Doesn't provide up to date and accurate information about overnight parking,0
"Virtually useless. It depends entirely on location setting so there is no way to research route ahead of time. It doesn't specify mile marker numbers so distance has to be calculated manually at best guess. And best of all, the app must be purchased to find out that it is useless, there is a no refund policy, read the fine print. I recommend using any of the truck stop apps such at Pilot or Love's or TA along with Google Maps. The information is comparable and no cost.",1
No compass north up on the map,0
App used to be good. Now it's busy with all those adds and very slow to show you locations,3
Tried to cancel for the last 5 days. Keeps trying to charge my credit card evwn though I no longer want the service.,0
This app is total junk anymore. Developers need to work on the mapping you spend more time trying to get the map to work then you do anything else. I paid $100 and it is not worth it anymore it used to be a great app for drivers but not anymore,4
Leaving Eric D. Cook??? Going all the way to Arizona or something? Yeah I Kno you cheat and nothing else,0
This was not only my favorite app but it was also FREE. Dealing with advertising pop ups was acceptable. This was a very useful app until stupidity and greed ruined it. I will look for another tool that is as convenient as this app once was.,4
"Absolute trash, utterly useless to me. There are better TRUCK gps apps for FREE!!!!!",2
A PULL OFF IS NOT A WEIGH STATION!!!,2
"Changes the route you have planned as you're driving, so you never notice. It does it when I'm close to a shipper/receiver, and now in the middle of my trip. I was wondering how I gained an extra hour to my trip. I have the alternative route off, so it shouldn't be an issue. There is no other setting I can find that would stop this. I can't wait to have a Garmin so I can drop this app.",0
Piece of garbage 👎👎👎 What are you guys smoking? This tool you priced so expensive and it's not work how it supposed. With every new version it's just getting worse. Totally disappointed and highly NOT RECOMMENDED to anyone.,1
Beware !!! I signed up for their 7 day FREE trail to see if this app was what I was looking for. It turns out that there were some features that app this did not have. So I cancelled on the morning of the 7th day and they had already charge my card for the full 6 month subscription. I contacted Trucker Path people to get a refund back on my card. They told me since I went thru google pay I would have to get with them. I contacted google pay and they told me it was Trucker Path's deal.,4
App is terrible now the update took away the update status bar and the scale history. Used to be a great app now I wouldn't recommend anyone using it.,4
It copies everything about Google maps then charges 25$ a month. No go. Just use Google maps truckers. Re: For a small fee of $29.99 I'll g8ve you feedback on how to improve your app.,1
"There is no response after they putting phone number to call they just saying we follow up with you but nothing, what kind f of customer service ya have",0
U gotta pay either way,0
"So now we can't use basic routing anymore without paying. I dont need a GPS I just use the basic version to see truck stops along my route. I see what your doing here Trucker Path. Make the free ""car"" route 150 miles longer and out of route but call the actual route, ""truck route"" and then try and charge us to use the actual correct and shortest route. This is an absolutely disgusting way to rip people off. Sad to see my beloved Trucker Path stoop to such a low level....",4
Glitchy and very irritating. New styles of windows forcing you to drive to a random location.,0
"Unsubbed because this damn app would not let me log in... kept telling me to complete my profile, then would tell me my phone# and email were already in use and I needed to change them... garbage issues for such an expensive subscription... I'll stick with CoPilot GPS.",0
Nothing free here.,0
"Since I've spent the annual 107 dollar amount this app freezes more than ever. I would not recommend it and I will NOT be renewing. It's useless unless you are just mapping or trip planning but for navigation it is not worth it....updated....well I have an updated Samsung s22. I am not the only person on this app stating the same freezing of the navigation, so it couldn't obviously be the device alone. Just admit it's better to use the trial then exit.",0
Tricks you with paying. Nope false advertising,0
"I've been using it for a month now and I will absolutely not trust it again....to start with, my VERY big problem with this app just happened to me twice in the last week, I marked my height at 14ft 3in , 3 days ago it took me on i35 north bound through tulsa ok and there was a bridge that was 14ft 1in! Luckily I was actually 14ft 1/2 in and barely made it. But I left my height the same this last time and it took me all the way through Kansas (14ft max, state law) so, I can't trust it!",0
You've got one year payment from me and trying to take monthly payments also. Too much.,0
"Useless as a ""free app"".",0
Clicked on 7 day free trial for GPS was charged same day. 159.51 nobody will give a refund. I canceled 2 days into 7 day free trial. Trucker Path and Google play both got me for my money. Update called like they told me to and because I did it from Google play there is nothing they can do,4
Can't stay zoomed in. And the screen won't stay tilted forward since this update. Trying to uninstall the update with no luck . Everything is so small now.,0
Apparently this app tracks your position and shares it with other users. Not worth that.,0
After updating it 4days ago it does still work ish but kick me out off the app,0
"The app is fine, the customer support around it is terrible as is the billing function withun the app. I cannot cancel my membership or remove my card via the app as the function doesnt work. As of right now I have 3 ""resolved tickets"" via the chat and email support systems canceling my membership and refunding last months charge of $9.99. I was charged again this morning, this time I called in and the only option is to have another service call me back and try to resolve the issue.",0
"Bro 😐 it takes forever to load even a small route , tried both data and wifi but 👎🏻",0
"The app is decent until a glitch. Customer support absolutely sucks. Twice now tickets have been opened, twice on each ticket but after that no response",0
Not working half of the time and sends you routes not allowed for trucks,0
Waste of money go to hammer it's free and better job,0
"Latest update ruined this app!! Doesn't show tolls anymore, and when you change departure times of one stop it doesn't update the ETA of the next stop! I have a 3 hr trip that arrives earlier than when I leave! Come on! The devs don't respond. I have an open ticket from months ago they haven't responded to and I'm a dang Diamond member!! 😡😡😡 it's a shame this is WAY better than any other apps for trip planning and is the de facto standard among other drivers",3
You guys really messed up this app,0
The reserve fueling to get a discount will hijack you 500 bucks and then have to wait 3 business days to get a refund. I guess a good way to save money,0
No longer has updated Fuel Prices. Most Fuel prices are days old.,4
The trip planner itinerary is horrible it takes over and I cannot use the app until I clear the trip and there's no way to avoid the trip itinerary from popping up. I really dislike this app now if I could I would give zero Stars,2
"""Current"" information is a joke. I've tried updating several incorrect fuel prices and it just thanks me for my valued input and doesn't change a thing. Passed the same gas stations on my way back and tried again, because they were still wrong, and again, nothing changed. Useless.",4
can't update fuel prices,4
I get 300 Dollar ticket for no truck route in Montreal 😡😡😡🤬🤬,4
AFTER READING THE REVIEWS... HHEELLL NNNOOO... I DON'T NEED IT... I WILL USE THE STARS TO GUIDE ME. 😂🤣😂🤣,2
"It uses verbage to make you think you are paying monthly for a subscription and that you can cancel any time, when you're actually paying for a whole year's worth all at once. You will not get a refund. If you ask the devs for one they tell you to talk to Google. If you talk to Google they'll tell you to talk to the devs. Also the app will randomly lock you out of your subscriber privileges. If you feel like getting robbed by scam artists, go ahead and subscribe.",0
Changing to much it's starting to be difficult to use,0
No information on how to use it .,0
"It's not that good, damn sure not worth paying for",0
Absolutely useless Gave me the exact same route as Google maps did directing me on the same exact parkway that commercial trucks are not allowed on,1
Why did you remove the silver subscription plan? It is the single most useful feature of the app but unless you pay for the gps navigation it's locked behind a $99 or $150 subscription fee and the silver plan was only $20,0
Trash nothing works in the app,0
The app stopped working before my $30 subscription ended.,0
No hazmat!!! 100 dollars a year for two stops at a time ridiculous.,0
Horrible directions doesn't list all truck stops .... Paid 30$/ month just to end up where I shouldn't have been.... I'll never use this app anymore,2
The app is super slow and glitchy And I want to unsubscribe but it's not letting me I will report to whoever I have to in order to get this done,0
Riddled with glitches! Good luck on getting a refund they're making it impossible!,0
"I am so disappointed in this app. Paid almost $200cnd for the Dimond subscription for 6mths, just under a month ago. I've tried almost daily to use the app and all it does is crash !!. I've emailed support twice about this problem and have yet to hear back. At this point I would not recommend this app at all!!",2
"B******* last update has ruined the entire app. Not responding not responding, not responding, wait, not responding, force close, not responding",0
"Bad, watch out they will charge the price and not tell you. Before you know it your passing 50+ dollars a month",0
"WHY WOULD ""TruckerPath"" REMOVE FOOD TAB AT EACH TRUCK STOP??? One with ALITTLE common sense would see that being a PROBLEM FOR TRUCKERS!!!",0
"App was great, now it crashes every 5 minutes after I paid for it.. Can't get a single route up without it crashing.. Navigation tab needs to be updated to avoid the constant crashes..",0
Dont waste your time downloading its not free,1
Too much advertising,0
You over charged me,0
Whats going on with the scale update? I cant see all the scales,0
App is useless now because of latest updates. App went from ok to terrible. Shame on engineers who ruin a product in order to ask for money to fix it. Stupid.,2
I have been trying for 2 weeks to purchase diamond package for the truck routes but it says to use a different payment instrument so I tried 2 other cards and it said the same message so I bought google play points and tried using them it still says use a different payment instrument PLEAS FIX THIS I NEED THIS APP,4
App is crashing every 10 seconds,0
Garbage,0
There are alot of weigh stations that showed up before that aren't even on the map now. Why are they no longer there? The weigh stations was my reason for downloading since no one uses a cb anymore for whatever reason. I just don't understand why you would not pin the locations when they were there before.,4
This app is absolutely a junk.. If you value your time and your equipment do not use this app It takes you to narrow roads lower Bridges and residential Don't waste a penny on this app,2
Not worth the money,0
App is glitchy and nonresponsive. This app used to work better when there was no paid subscription,3
Bad navigation. Google maps does much better. They will route way out of the way because they have it as a 30 mph highway and it is a 55 mph highway. Happened multiple times. Planning to unsubscribe.,1
Cost too much for what it does,0
"They keep updating the app which makes it less and less user friendly. Everytime I have to re learn how to use it, where they put things ""this"" time. Quick pic selections hidden so I can't go through each one individually without going into a setting. GPS isn't giving me multiple routes and the routes they pick are either out of the way or make zero sense. I'm a paying user and I'm getting very dissatisfied",0
"I paid money for an app that contains to crash. This app does stay up for more then 30 sec. I would like to speak with someone about a refund, but I can't open the app to file and complaint.",2
Be upfront and explain fees first.,0
"Useless - Need a $150 subscription before truck routes made available. 7 day free trial but they want credit card info straight away, so they can put on auto renew when you forget the 7 days is up. What a disappointment.",4
"Horrible, this app sent me 100 miles down a state highway then told me to turn around and go back to where I started and take a different route. Later it crashed over and over. It keeps asking me about parking where I was yesterday! Complete trash. It does not tell you if weigh stations are open, you cannot alter your route and it just adds more stress to my day. Do not pay for this app. I did the 7 day trial and canceled but they still took $167 out of my account and refuse to refund it. CROOKS",3
I've been using this app for about 2 years it's been a great app but when they did the last update I updated app and now nothing works so Up until that point I would have given it 5 stars..... Uninstalled,1
"Latest update is terrible. The navigation freezes and does not give turn by turn. It's stuck on the original location. Also, have to close and clear trip to get stop locations to show on drive. Hit and miss either the pop up box showing miles and type of truck stops coming up. Uninstalled/reinstalled 3xs. We depend on you. Please fix this ASAP.",3
Useless since last update. Shouldn't charge your subscribers til it's fixed,0
"Leads you off major roadways onto back roads that make no sense at all!! The gps wanted me to drive through a residential neighborhood to get to shipper, luckily I have enough common sense to ignore it and find a commercial route.",0
Has trouble routing even tho paying substitution ...,0
Do not recommend this app it sent me down the wrong road ended up in a red zone in California and got a $200 ticket because of this app...,0
Apps GPS thinks I'm in Iowa when I'm in Los Angeles,0
"Fraud. I tried it for a couple days, didn't like it, canceled my subscription and they still took $167 from my account. It's fraud and it's Illegal. You picked the wrong guy to steal from",0
Wasted my time down loading this app again it I could use the gps routing free put info in and kept taking me to the subscription page will uninstall now and find something else dont down load this app unless you want to spend 150.00 per year goodbye trucker path.,1
Losses gps all the time,0
We might be switching to HAMMER!!! My buddies and I use to recommend trucker path to any one who didn't know we thought it was the next best thing since sliced bread but then updates after updates it just gotten worst and worst and this last update it's unusable. It's giving incorrect eta incorrect mileage it use to give you multiple routr options to choose but now it's just one & it's usefully the longest route. These are problems on android and iPhone.,4
Horrible,0
Not useful unless you pay for a subscription,0
"Why do computer nerd retards keep ruining literally every app? If it ain't broke it doesn't need to be fixed, dummies. Every update makes this app worse. No wonder less and less drivers are using it. It was pretty good a few years ago. It's a dumpster fire now.",0
"This app went from usable to worthless. Who told you programmers without CDL that doing this last update was a good idea? When turning on a filter (ex. Truck stops, scales) and panning around to the right one, the GPS pinpoint to take me back to my location is gone. No amount of zooming in or out fixes it unless we go back to general layout without filters. When clicking on a truck stop or rest areas I pass by, now get a worthless list. Ugh. Done! Time to uninstall",2
Won't let me add more than 500 truck stops to my favorites list.,4
"My truck driver brother and I looked at this app together, trying to figure out whether it would be worth the cost. You can get maps, lists of truck stops, and gas oeices from other apps, so what else does this one have? It predicts where there is open parking. ""I can predict whether there will be parking in my head. There either will or won't be space available."" We weren't convinced.",2
Didn't work for me. Now I can't cancel the free trial. Wth!!,4
Went from great app to ok to useless. Latest update you can't even update a scale? Not to mention everything you touch on map takes you to a list. I could care less about seeing a list or having to click more info on a list. It's just an added unnecessary thing to do. Y'all could mess up a wet dream. Instead of fixing things that weren't broke maybe you should have fixed the glitch that defaults to prepass only if you accidently click it because a list pops up every time you click something.,3
I can ready been trying to contact some but no success,0
You have to pay for it,0
How do I cancel this I got charged for it and I dont want it,0
This is the Internet Explorer of navigation apps. This app will let you know that a road is closed due to construction and then still tell you to drive through it. Rerouting after missing an exit is like asking a stubborn child to do something,0
App dont work right hafe the time and dont show all truck stops glad i didnt pay for the pay part of this app,3
The app will not let me unsubscribe,0
APP IS NOT LOADING ANYTHING.,0
I hate the new up date every thing is very hard to read also search bar is not at the top of page and does not give me the option to use maps.. it also does not speak to me when a turn is comming up,0
"I WANT MY MONEY BACK ... TRIED YOUR APPT SOME TIME AGO (LONG TIME AGO - YEARS) Y'ALL KEEP TAKING MONEY OFF MY CARD - IVE CANCELED AND CANCELED YET Y'ALL STILL WITHDRAW- ((FIX THE PROBLEM)) IM NOT AUTHORIZING YOU TO WITHDRAW ANY MONEY FROM ANY OF MY FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS. ""PUT MY MONEY BACK!",0
"Recent updates have ruined the app. Slow,slow slow. Can no longer login with 2 devices. My tablet install is really slow, no good for finding parking places. My phone install is faster, yet slow. Since the tablet is only good for a known address. I use my phone to find parking. Unfortunately cannot be logged in with both devices. Login with one, it logs out the other. This is very disappointing and a pita. I pay for a subscription. Not going to continue. Chat support does not work. No support!",0
Subscribed to it once for 38 bucks monthly thought I could use it. Well turns out it's buggy as hell most of the time. What a rip off I use waze now and it's just fine.,0
Im trying to get to a certain place in NY and for some reason it wants to send me to MN!! Like i pay money for this app. I updated it and its still doing it!!,0
"-Warned me of weight station 30 miles ahead. Then never gave me any warning about it. Asked afterward if it was open. Didn't warn me about the next 3. But asked if they where open. -Constantly saying welcome to Virginia, even tho im I've been in the state for 5 hours. - sever weather ahead warning repeated a dozen times. This happened every hour or so. Mispronounced it each time. - drove on the same road for over 100miles. Every 10 miles or so itcount down to continue strait in x miles.",0
"I WAS CHARGED $30/MONTH TWICE, BUT I DON'T SEE WHERE YOUR CONTENT TELLS INDIVIDUALS THAT INFO",0
Probably the worst GPS app ever has too many ads and if you want to navigate on a simi you have to pay for priumuim soooo what's the point of this app then. It's like a slap in the face to truckers. Have it installed but never use it.,2
"Update. This navigation constantly sends you to roads with weigh limit and length restrictions. On Sep 26 at Manhattan, IL I got a ticket because there is a length restriction (up to 65 feet straight length). This GPS didn't even recognized the restriction... The navigation change path by itself without alerting a driver. In many cases it's creating a path through tight and unnecessary turns.",0
Used to be great!! Now.....Not so much. They've added so much bloat to the app. Perhaps they should have left this app alone and created a second app for GPS and such. This thing is laggy and buggy now.,3
"Not what I wanted, didn't want to pay for features I don't need.",0
"Used to be great. Now it's full of bugs and glitches. Emails after emails to the company with no fixes. Not re-upping my subscription. Will stick with a free competitor. Sad. If they just took some time to listen they would have a superior app, unbeatable. Maybe one day",3
"I used this app for a couple of years, and I regret spending the hundreds of dollars on it. Neither Trucker Path nor Hammer are perfect, but the Hammer app provides FREE truck navigation. If Hammer can provide free truck navigation, (that gets the job done) I don't understand why Trucker Path should cost so much. 2 or 3 bucks a month I could get behind for the SLIGHTLY better features it has....but 20-30 bucks a month is an obvious grift with truckers as the target.",4
A horrible complete rip off. The price they charge you can get the same stuff for completely free with truck driver power. This app is the worst thing I have ever paid for and then when I tried to get my money back both Google and trucker pack denied me my refund,2
I never asked for your loads. Please stop sending me loads. I tried muting blocking and everything but you guys won't stop. Even if I give you money you still won't stop,0
"Years later and Trucker Path still is a miss leading app. Over 70% of the parking is not for full size tractor-trailers, 30% parking doesn't exist. The fuel prices are never correct, this app is very slow.",4
"I downloaded this App on my old phone and it worked, now I have a new phone, I downloaded the app, logged in and it's not recognizing that I paid for membership already, however it just withdrew $29.99 from my bank account. I've uninstalled this app from my new phone and will speak with my bank to return my money, I feel I've been scammed.",0
This app continues to vas m charge me and don't have a phone to contact them to stop charging a person!!!!!,0
Paywall. Nearly 25 a month.,0
I installed this app and wanted to tried it for 48 before buying a monthly subscription I got charged for two consecutive months even after Uninstalled when I found out they charged me for the first time whiteout my consent and Google play store did not help by telling me two month after my request for refund to contact the developer for resolution,0
"The ""altered perspective"" where it tries to show you street view when searching for a stop needs to go and I can't add a atop anymore because it times out and just keeps loading",0
It Didn't say you had to buy the truck routes,4
"Sadly had to delete app. It works fine but I had another user ask me about a place I had been. I didn't share my location or even open the app at this location. I can't find a way to turn off location sharing in settings. I am unwilling to have an app disclose my location without permission. *Edit- to developer. As you will note in the review, I stated I didn't open the app, share location and what was not mentioned but should've been understood was no review was left for location in question.",2
"Not a trucker, but sometimes I use the truck roads because they're not as crowded. The app was SO hard to understand and use. I can't even type in my point A to B because it keeps directing me to my nearest (100miles away) truck stop.",0
"It's not free as they are advertising, Truck driving map is not included in free offer, SCAMMER",0
"Doesn't provide truck specific routes. Basically, this is the paid version of Google.",0
No free dark mode even after an update. Subscription-ware at its finest.. among many other things.,0
"Selects wrong route and always plans for a U turn even after I change the settings. Same with Toll roads, it will being me to toll roads after I change the setting to no Tolls. Many times it has changed the route in transit creating a longer trip. Unreliable GPS in my experience and has cost me time and money.",0
No update ever fixes bugs,0
Keeps changing the route from the one that I pick and will have me get off the freeway to turn around and get back on.,0
"It was nice app, before they started to force you to use their stupid maps",0
Keeps causing my phone to have major issues,0
I tried to cancel the free trial and they put me on with some automated texting person who could not or would not help me cancel. Don't get anything from this app even the free trial.,4
Keep changing it,0
ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!,0
"I am trying to install the app on my new iPad with abysmal results.  Trucker Path, you NEED to make this app trucker friendly to old school truckers.  Definitely rating this an F for failure to load app to new devices.  Stop thinking about how to make your job easier and start thinking about how to make it easier for truckers when we get new devices.  Absolutely horrible to use.",4
"App is locked behind a paywall for truck drivers.,.",0
"I run over dimension loads all the time. This app you have the ability to put in all the dimensions of your rig, however it gives you a generic truck route with zero reflection of bridge heights, lan width restrictions etc. Don't buy this app, it's a waste of money for the subscription. Also, they only communicate with you via text chat or email, you will never be able to speak to a human being. More than likely its just a garbage ""team"" from the middle east",4
"Won't show weigh stations, it used to be a great app, now it's terrible",4
Subscription is too expensive.,0
"Clever response but I'm always updated.U-turns& residential streets. Will reroute you without warning. Adding a new location?Wont work.Doesnt suggest obvious destinations within 200 miles,suggest irrelevant destinations more than 500miles away.Constant errors for commonly used features like checking status of weigh stations.Icons for truckstops,rest stops,weigh stations etc.disappear from route. Sets course to commonly known restricted routes. Worst experience ever,will put a driver in danger.",0
Downloaded map is not working if there is no Internet! What's the point for offline mode and downloaded maps if they are not working without signal. Uninstalling and canceling my subscription.,0
They took the favorites button away. This app just keeps getting worse. Used to be a great app,4
"I click unsubscribe but it takes me here to uninstall. Not the same thing!! Edit 7/29/22 Just noticed my card has been charged again even though I don't use the app, and google isn't showing it as an active subscription. I can't seem to be rid of it. I have sent 2 emails to the support address. If this happens again I will be forced to take legal action against this company for malpractice. Please refund my $157 charged on 7/29/22 and remove me from all of your systems.",2
Not worth paying for. Waste drivers time with nonsense like asking for parking status a mile from location. Also screen in now cluttered with fuel prices and locations of 3 closest stops. I'm an Owner Op who likes to make my deliveries on time so I stop very seldom. Every update is more of a nightmare. I've been using Google maps and old school research so this subscription could get canned since it constantly asks for more money like I'm an ATM.,4
"Use to be a great app. Ever since the last update, nothing is coming up. I had to uninstall and then reinstall the app, just to get the app to work. You guys need to fix this bug problem please. It might help. Thanks.",4
"This is a awful app that does not care about the quality of its service and they just want your money. Plenty of other free apps at least try to make something usable, not just a bunch of useless and incorrect info unless i pay up. Esspecially when i can look it up for free.",0
U subscribe and it won't let me not Dat mych help,4
Horrible.,0
I don't want to pay for your program and it will not let me use it unless I pay now I've used it for 6 years and now it refuses I'm at the point where I hate your program,0
"You have to purchase in order to get truck routes, without purchase it only uses car routes 👎👎.... I uninstalled app right away!",4
App pushed so hard to give a 7 day trial that I was forced to use it when I wasn't able to test it. Now I'll never know and you get a 1 star for being so pushy.,0
Worked better when it was free. Now they charge and doesn't work as good,0
💯,0
Never at the same place I am at it shows me being in Seattle Washington and I have not been there in 2 months not a good app to use anymore,1
"Everytime i open the app, it tracks me at the other side of the continent. One out of 5 times, it treats me like a new install Annoying AF",2
Cancel subcription,0
"This app used to be good, but recently has become a buggy mess. I have to open, close, then reopen the app just to get it to function, it takes 5 to 7 seconds to register any change to a route, and the navigation itself is lackluster at best, and hazardous at worst. I've had this thing try to take me down very narrow switchbacks on a mountain road that was very clearly not designed for a 53' trailer. And numerous other issues that I can't fit in 500 characters. Not worth a $30 subscription.",3
"Worst app, cancelled right away and still charge me for the whole year.",0
Junk,0
Have to pay extra to use actual truck navigation and still couldn't make it work or load route. So uninstalled and looking at alternatives.,0
Cost money. Better off just buying a trucker GPS. No offense.,0
Is not free . Wasting time and data download it. Plus it's too slow. So far 1 star,0
"poor customer service Unreachable, not replying to emails",0
This Trucker path app only works for US locations. Could not use this app in Ontario,2
"I hate what this app has become. In the beginning you were able to open the app, search for the nearest truck stop, and get a general idea of the location to the truck stop (most of us only need a highway and an exit number). Seeing if a truck stop has space is marginally usefull since anyone can give an erroneous status (full if there's spaces available, some spots when it's 100% full, etc). The repeat ads upon opening the app is useless. And no self respecting driver cares about points.",0
This thing was pretty darn good until the last update and now you can't get it to navigate it keeps asking you what entrance to use you touch it and it does nothing,0
After the last review the app is not loading the maps properly on Android devices,0
"This app is just gotten worse over the years pushing paid subscription I understand there are some people that use all those features, But I don't need it pushed on me every time I opened it to look for a truck stop I do my part by updating Way station updates parking updates. It used to be so great when it came out I don't know why they ever had to sell it To some money hungry capitalist. I find myself using it less and less and thinking about Uninstall it",2
Too bad,0
Stop my 7 day trial. I don't like the app.,0
Crashes everytime not getting an error screen it just closes the app. Cancelled my membership $30/month for an app that won't work. I should get a refund.,4
Not user friendly,0
Terrible... won't even let me unsubscribe... not happy with trial and impossible to cancel stay away from this app.,4
Charged me before free trial was up. Will dispute charge with my bank.,4
"I wish I never installed this app. Even though I deleted it years ago I'm still being harassed multiple times a week, including weekends, by their telemarketing scammers.",0
You need to let people know ahead of time that you have a monthly fee.,0
"AD spam is RELENTLESS, used to be the GOAT and for the people.......",0
I contacted trucker path to cancel my subscription and they told me they couldn't. I keep getting charged. These guys are a bunch of thieves. Stay away.,3
"This app was once fairly decent but here lately it has been a disaster. If it's not glitching and freezing up, the location is inaccurate. I'm currently in Mineola TX headed west and it shows me in Henrietta OK headed east. What a joke!!",0
Won't let me cancel,4
"USED to be a great app. Now it just makes me angry more often than it helps me. Endless adds, and they made it less user friendly. STOP CHANGING SOMETHING THAT AINT BROKEN.",4
Why I can't use Google maps for direction to the truck stops anymore? I'd assume is so I feel forced to buy premium? It's not happening though,1
They call right away and want you to sign up for more stuff that I don't need. The navigation is no good.,2
Works beautifully on iOS. This app on Android is absolute trash and hardly usable. Too many glitches and system malfunctions to list.,0
Why does the app freeze when you set a route and it gives you the option for add to current trip or plan new trip. If you select plan new trip it freezes.,0
Free trial is a lie they took 160 dollers unauthorized transaction out of my account and want give me my hard earned money back this app is a scam,4
Again Google maps not available...,1
"I got this app because of NYC. But the app is just as bad as all other gps in NYC. It took me down roads that were not for trucks and I even found myself in front of 11 food bridges. Also, I had other technical problems.",0
"Muy mala, pago mensual por esta app y da muchos problema, cada semana sale con un problema nuevo etc...",0
It is the most buggiest stupidest GPS app I use for trucking. It's freaking ridiculous. I've had to redownload it about five different times in the last 2 days just to be able to make a route cuz it will bug out and won't even let you do anything. So thanks. But don't worry I pay the money so you'll still get your dough,1
Don't use this app it is a scam they will over charge you and tell that they have no refund policy.,2
"Imagine marketing yourself as a truck GPS and then charging a monthly fee for said truck gps. Plenty of free alternative out there, no thanks",2
You may not have my phone number.,0
This app is a convoluted cluster F! And it will gobble up your battery in no time flat! How many places after places after places do you need? GEEZ!,0
I requested you to cancel my acct. Over a month ago. But yet again you charge me for a app I no longer use or need. Quite stealing my hard earned money. And refund that money you took.,0
"Nightmare to CANCEL. You are sent to cancel via Google Play, and then only able to suspend for up to 3 months. Just a nightmare to cancel this mess.",0
GPS routing does NOT use truck routes. Need to cancel but there is no option to cancel membership via the app,4
Having performance issues since update,0
By far the worst GPS app out there it is pointless to even be subscribing to something if it's going to crash every time you try to load it not to mention the fact that it is constantly glitching and none of its features are easy to navigate nor are the updates on availability of parking actually worth the time to look at.,0
Not free,0
They charged me after I canceled my order a month ago,0
Your guys update screwed it up. I had to uninstall and reinstall just to get new routes each time today. I am a local freight of all kinds driver and my trucking GPS is important. Only reason I have not left you already is because I don't have time to look for a new GPS before I get home...,0
App freezing and getting stuck,0
"On my s22 this app absolutely suck to the max, it takes forever to load and even worst when you use satellite view, I will not renew this app, Google maps or Apple maps has your app beat by a million miles.",1
What a disaster of an app. Most of the time it said the scales were closed they were open. Anyone who actually believes anything a truck driver says deserves to pay over 30 dollar a month.,2
"I signed up for a free month of maps, or so I thought, was reasonably satisfied and was probably going to continue with the service, and I have an unexplained charge on my credit card for 149.99. This for a service that is supposed to run 29.95 a month. No reciept, no explanation. Every time you sign up for something online it's the same scam.",0
I canceled this app..it would change the route and you wouldn't know it until you almost get screwed up..it directed me to roads that don't allow big trucks on and one time it wanted me to cut through a hospital parking lot..waist of money..,0
"This app is pay, no free",0
"Be careful when you pay, system charging you automatically without your permit",0
"Why can't I use Google maps anymore, your map not good. This use to be a great ap now someone made bad",1
So you removed the link to Google maps??? Smart. Very smart,1
I've untinstalled unsubscribed yet they still keep trying to charge my card.,0
Not,0
Scammed by your sales representative about features that do not exist,0
Won't let me unsubscribe. Just brings me here.,4
"Bad experience. Sent me down several closed roads. Off the highway, by-pass, to back road and they were closed. No trucks. I canceled my membership, it keeps trying to take the 9.99 out of.my acct.",0
This app will take you way around the bush to get from point A to B,0
Would be better free,0
Newest update broke the app Also full of ads and they haven't fixed any issues for like 3 months now switch to hammer,2
Un able to cancel the subscription,3
Extremely annoying. Have to go through 4 different screens and pop-ups just to use app for 5 seconds. Used to be better than that.,2
Another sellout app.....went from being a helpful app for truck drivers to just another app to wring out money from these drivers.,0
What makes companies think they can keep you from unsubscribing. Go through a free trial and just rob you of your money. Forget about trying to get a hold of anybody to resolve this issue these types of companies need to be shut down.,4
"PAID FOR THE GOLD VERSION, After an update I found tolls were no longer able to be calculated and was told that feature was removed no refund offered or given. Why they can justify removing options you already paid for is rediculous, uninstalled the app and found other optionssince they also have raised there subscrition fees by 5x the amount when the app came out.",0
Stole$108.61 out of my bank account without my permission no receipt no nothing just missing $108.61 out of my account from TRUCKER PATH. BECAREFUL EVERYONE WATCH YOUR ACCOUNTS,4
"Been trying to unsubscribe for the last couple of weeks, keeps bringing me to the app store...which makes NO sense. Not to mention since I've been driving, this app has NEVER helped. I want my money back!",0
"Screen goes black and sends to none truck route,",4
"If I sign up for premium can I customize the page layout? You have added so many menus that the screen is too cluttered to be of any use. The ""search for address"" pops up every time the screen is touched and it takes up half the screen. I never use the option and it gets in the way. Now you have added ""plan trip"" function smack dab in the middle of the screen. What idiot thought that was a good idea? Give me the option to get rid of all the useless screen clutter and I will buy the premium!",0
"Deleting, your membership fee is crazy talk and anyone looking for a ""truck"" gps app should just purchase a truck gps and not have to pay $299/year! ✌🏼",2
Think it's junk,0
TA/Petro truck stops are NOT appearing on app. Please fix this bug/glitch as soon as possible.,2
"Ads now pop up every time you open the app and for no apparent reason it no longer shows TA/Petro. More annoying than useful now, better off using alternatives.",2
Congratulations now I can't find any ta/Petro locations with this newest update,0
"Doesn't seem like this app is actually for truckers since it constantly tells me to go on routes that specifically say no trucks allowed. Also, how many semi's should be making u turns, anywhere, ever? Certainly not my truck, and definitely not on highways.",0
Truck routing not that good hard to unsubscribe,0
GPS is worse than my rand McNally! And there's nothing useful compared to the free option! I canceled my free trial Monday and today I got charged for a year membership! What a bunch of scammers!!! They better give me my money back,4
Wont let me unsubscribe!,4
"This app got me lost, had me going the wrong way, lost money and time. stop billing my card. I canceled my prescription and don't want it, and you keep trying to take money from my card, stop. No longer interested don't want it",0
"Calling your app Trucker Path, but only offering truck routes as a premium feature is trash. Also, only have annual membership and not a monthly is also trash. This app used to be worth it but not anymore.",4
Can't get a route...redirects to paid subscription,0
I canceled my subscription to this app. They have been zero help in refunding me my money. They refuse to take responsibility and have sent me to everyone else for the refund. Be positive you will need/want this app because if not you will be out $299.,0
"First time I used it it took me straight down a no truck route. I didn't take it, I knew it was a no truck route. Luckily I knew the area and was just checking to see how well this app worked. If I had not known, and followed the directions, things could have been very bad",4
App keeps crashing,3
"Very frustrating app. Constantly freezing, crashing, and locking up",0
Free app works great Paid app stops working and they still charge you,0
"I've used this for 5yrs w/o 1 single solitary issue from app not 1!!! forced to update and the problems flood. Not to mention the adds. why can't America just enjoy profits what it deserves from a solid product, instead we MUST design our products to fail 😠",0
"Using this app since September 2022. This is the glitchiest app I've ever used, and they charge you money for it. And looks like it's not gonna get fixed anytime soon",1
I refuse to pay to use this stupid app,0
It attempted to update all day and night long... I uninstalled as I rarely used it anyway. Baahwooshh 😀 android 5G,0
"It's become trash in the last 6 months. Most of the time you can't click on weigh stations, fuel stops or anything and view posted info. Why? ""Error Happened"". Good luck getting a last minute scale status.",4
Absolute garbage now! Way to go guys you took a really good helpful app and ruined it because of you wanting your ads to take priority over the user! Huge lag makes my phone crash and freeze up will be uninstalling immediately I've had enough,0
how to down load trucker path.,4
Was good till app charged me $160.00 without consent,0
Took me to a restricted route. Thank God I had a way out. I would not buy this service!!!!,0
Wow I pay $15 a month and it is still asking me for more money if I want to add more than 2 stops on my way!!! This is unacceptable.This app is way too expensive.Plus on the turns the arrow says right and the voice says turn left! It happens all the time. I'm gonna stick with Hammer app. No thanks.,0
Sometimes the route doesnt make any sense.,0
"Gave them my information once, years ago. Now they won't stop calling to THREATEN ME with compliance and restrictions! They have no phone number to initiate contact. They won't stop calling with THREATS...",0
To many ads. Don't need it that bad. I'm done with it,2
$25 a month...,0
I wish to unsubscribe,0
To damn expensive only thing I use is for fuel prices,4
It's very difficult to use this app when you don't have a semi,3
This truck navigation has had so many issues...especially the voice that directs you...now it's to a point we're I can't even understand it and I'm missing turns and it's effecting my job I will take it down soon before I get fired!!,0
AVOID THIS APP AND ANY FREE TRIAL! I was charged $149 without any notification three days before trial ended. Their response was that it's not their responsibility to refund since it was downloaded via Google Play.  Google said it was the developer's responsibility to refund and they denied the refund. So now I'm dealing with the developers once again.  It should not be this difficult to get a proper refund.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED Had to get my bank involved as a last resort.,4
Very poor quality. Too many ads. Tries to be too much and instead does everything poorly. Doesn't deserve 1 star. Uninstalled,0
"A year ago I would have said that this was a must-have app for truckers, but now it's an add riddled mess. On top of that the payed stuff isn't worth even a fraction of what they're asking for. It's a real shame to see a once excellent app fall this far.",0
Can't find a lot of locations,0
Can't unsubscribe. Keeps giving an error.,0
"Bad. Extremely difficult to start up. Chose types of stops along a 600mi route I know and not one single type of stop listed. No truck stops. No rest areas. Not to mention the need to give credit card info for ""free"" 7 day trial period.",2
The only reason I downloaded this app was to see if the scale houses were open. The navigation sucks,0
Bad experience. App crush many times during using. Can give you wrong way to your distinction. Had many problems. Can crush at any time. Google maps give you better experience.,1
Very terrible app,0
"The amount of ads is insane, and impairing when trying to find a truck stop as fast as possible. Used to pay for the app, would have considered it again but now I refuse on principle. You exit an ad, it pops another one in less than 5 seconds. Frustrating and makes me hate the company. Will be looking for a new app.",3
"After last update, screen keeps going black and not showing me turn until last minute on half screen",0
These ppl reply to me then I can't find it. Somehow they are deleting bad reviews. This app is illegal. To many button pushes to get rid of ads. Must fix.,0
"As an app, trucker path is extremely useful. The advertisements on the free version are actively hostile to users now. The banner ad on the top covers up the satellite view button, and every time you start the app, 3 to 4 full screen ads pop up that must be dismissed. I don't mind ads, but this is just ridiculous.",4
"If we get the paid version, can we pick and choose which menus we want on launch? Other apps do that. So much new stuff isn't useful in my case. The new zoom in blue thing is so annoying, incomprehensible. We all use Google satellite view.",1
"Useless on bc coast in canada I unsubscribed after a month, trys to take you down roads that ARE NOT truck routes... extremely frustrating and dangerous...",4
"I use and payed for a month, first it took me on a very bad curvy small town road, not for trucks, second the U turns all the time, get a real gps , I invest on a rand McNally, because this app has a lot of mistakes, I can use my paper map and do a custom rout on Gmaps and it will be better, no weather alerts , wrong exits , u turns. I stopped the membership after a month.",0
Makes my phone randomly restart and freeze also keeps putting me on illegal routes phone is a Google pixel 6 Pro would just randomly restart with no warning deleted all apps I didn't use and updated everything still happened noticed didn't seem to happen when had this app off deleted the app and haven't had the issue anymore,0
Horrible Map. It has been glitchy and now map is not working correctly at all. I should note I use a paid version.,0
"Charged me 149.99 for 6 months before the 7 day trial was up and will not give me my money back stating its googles fault..... What idiot will spend 300.00 a year on garbage GPS when you can just buy one even at a truck stop for that much, and it comes with lifetime map updates, HOS and all that bs..... Ps: Their GPS is trash, uses alot of Google car routes, and sometimes it'll try to route me very far around my destination. And I don't have the wrong setting checked either....",0
Pop up ads and it shuts down very annoying when driving....please fix it,0
Not paying to use your app.. laim. Also the adds are not appropriate during a trip.,2
Do not give these bastards your phone number for verification. Within 6 hours of doing so my phone has been blowing up by spammers and text scammers. I should have known better.,0
Cant open the app,2
I canceled this account months ago and still being charged for it,0
"This app is now functioning like adware. It's been a valuable resource to me for years, however in recent months it's degraded into garbage. It was bad enough that they started pushing 3-4 consecutive pop-us upon opening, with enough delay that you think it's over, only to be interrupted yet again. Then they put a large banner at the top of the screen which covers half of the satellite view button. Now I've uninstalled it because it's opening the Play Store to install apps(ads) even when closed.",0
Always says error happened. Doesn't show the parking or scales open/closed anymore.,0
im sorry but it was awesome when i first started but now its so slpw its not even funny,0
Gotta pay for anything trucking dont call it trucker path if your going to be petty and give auto directions for free and charge for anything trucking F you money hungry POS,4
Really bad app,0
This is starting to freeze up while I'm driving down the road I'm Paying 200 plus dollars a year for this garbage I'm going to have to start shopping around for a new trucker app,0
"The only reason I use this app is for the truck entries which are fairly accurate. The navigation is TERRIBLE! And dangerous! I have to constantly clear the trip, re-enter the route and start all over again, because the app stops tracking the current miles and gets stuck. The user experience is also very unfriendly. Having to go into the itinerary to make changes is very cumbersome. Why not be able to long press on a stop to delete it? Too dangerous for a Commercial driver to fumble around with!",2
"""Error happened"" message comes up even after deleting app and reinstall. And restarting phone. Fix your end app. One star right now is being generous",0
"Forget this app it never works with all the updates you all do, all you guys tell me is we are looking into it and nothing is done about it! Canceled my account already Hammer GPS is way better and actually works.",0
Garbage stopped letting me look up addresses.,0
Waste of money,0
Sure is funny how there's always a driver reporting error when trying to find out what the northbound Minnesota scale is doing on interstate 35 practically every day after 3:00 p.m.,0
"Very bad, inaccurate, it took me crazy turns and places, not reliable for scales, there is no heads up for rest area and gas stations, very often it is not working and cause is apparently there is no internet connection and truly internet is working fine, then suddenly it changes your route and gives me 120 miles extra for no reason it just took me of I5 (luckily I knew where to go). It's just not worth money they are asking, 2 or 3 dollars maybe but 50 noooo",0
Your new update REALLY SUCKS. can't hardly use it at all now. Have to click on it half a million times to get the screen to clear out good enough to see the map. What are you people thinking? The only reason you haven't heard any issues with this app is because you're ignoring them. It's almost useless with all the ads covering up EVERYTHING. I'd NEVER consider paying for it if that's the kind of people you are.,1
It is suppose to have a free version. I guess they want you to pay for it. 🙄,0
Pop up ads aren't enough it seems. While you're looking for your next stop on the map the app will bring you to the play store for some other app or game they're advertising. Happens to the point the app causes you to lose time. Going to just switch to Google maps from now on because trucker path has become too unreliable.,1
"Man this app went down hill fast. When it was free, it was amazing. At this point, I wish I never knew about this app. Every so often I'll try to use it, but it's just a frustrating waste of time and data now.",1
App really trying too hard to force you to pay ands asks too many questions,0
Tried the free trial at 7am two hrs in this app had me on non truck routes and one neighborhood. Then checked my subscriptions truck path was going to charge my account 143.00 dollars on the 4th of april. No way cancelled it less than 4hrs of the 7 day trial straight ripp off...,4
I see that decide to rip driver off. Well goodbye. Ripoff.,0
"Had me running around chicago telling me to go under all the low clearance bridges even though i had my settings configured for a 13'6"" refer trailer took me to 4 different 13'0"" bridges app is absolutely worthless get a dedicated truck gps like garmin or rand mcnally its worth the money",2
"UPDATE 03.23.2022 I am seriously disappointed in the new changes that Trucker Path has made to this app. Now when I open the app I get hit with 3 and 4 completely useless ads that cover the entire screen. You're making a once really great app into another commercialized frustration We need a Trucker Path replacement. Update, I JUST WANT THE APP TO TURN ON. GET RID OF THESE STUPID ADS! Update. No the app is kicking me out and over to Google Play. This is just plain UNSAFE!",4
It use to be good,0
I want to give this a good review but I can't. Because the mileage is different from the first click to what's on the full page. Since the last update it's worse now the maps are disappearing from the screen,0
This app is nothing but ads as soon as you push one button it goes to 4 different ads you press the button again and goes to 4 to 5 more ads and even sometimes opens up the Google store and try to make you install the app that it's advertising this app is extremely annoying and unless you're willing to pay for the upgrades on it it's worthless,2
Well I tried it for the free week. I cancelled it a day or 2 before day 7. Still got charged for it. Contacted trucker path they said I had to go through Google. They are a joke and piss poor customer service.,0
Not road friendly tells me to take illegal turns,0
This was a very good app but they want you to pay for things that were free 👎,0
This app doesn't take you to the actual site and it also takes you to streets that you can't go down.. It's not a good app right now. 😒,3
This app has become absolutely ridiculous. You have to pay for every single little feature now. As well as being inundated with ad spam non-stop. I just tried to open the app to look ahead and see what truck stops are along a certain route that I was deciding to take. I had to close out eight different pop-ups before I could see the map. This app has gotten ridiculous ever since it has been taken over. I cannot wait to see somebody make an alternative and shut you down!,2
"Changed my review from 5 to 1 star because of the pop up adds. So annoying when you got one mile to decide if you want to stop or not. I'll be looking for another. No, I don't want your sucky navigation!",0
**edit 3/29/22**Used to be a good app. Now it's barely usable just for ad pop-ups. Need a lite version that does nothing but list truckstops. No navigation or any of the other stuff.,3
doesnt want to download too much difficult to add the app,0
Retired from 47 years and they still take money even after uninstall,0
"App just updated.. And now I try to find a route from point a to point b and I always get ""something went wrong error"" tried multipul times. Uninstalled.",0
Went from being a great resource to being a pain to use. Multiple pop ups before being able to use the map is making me not want to use the app. It is getting to be too difficult to use when you're in a hurry for quick info. Wont be using much longer.,4
How many pop up apps are you planning on having us click out of everyday? Had 6 in a row just now.,0
Slow takes 15 minutes to reroute dose not avoid tolls when set to avoid tolls canceled membership on 7th day still took the monthly payment.,0
There's no universe that exists where I would pay that price for this app when there are other apps that do this for free.,0
3-4 popup ads when you start it than an ad for a premium subscription is getting old,0
"Don't waste your money. The app is useless for a trucker that needs to see ahead a couple of miles down the road. While driving the view is so close that you are unable to react on time, like a truck stop or gas station. By the time you see it in the map you passed it. The view is like 800 feet ahead. Emailed them 3 times, no response Chat is useless because they can't help with this issue. If you set the map to north it goes west all the time.",2
Not free,0
Not working,0
So many ads not worth it and I'm not paying for it,0
Stops my calls from coming through when in use.,0
Some routes are not exactly for commercial Vehicles preferred System make difficult to complete profile Even harder to get customers service to answer back 14 days while is 7 day to test how good or bad is the product Point of interest along the routes have more steps than need to be. Maybe in a year or two get better,0
With this pop up commercial this app became very annoying.. I'm already looking for replacement!,0
What was once a great app... The amount of popup ads has to be contributing to distracted driving. The ads... Just... Won't... Stop.. popping up!,4
"Calling all Non-greedy developers, please build a similar app that doesn't overwhelm us with ads. This app is handy when it isn't hounding you to pay a subscription (which would be a waste of money) or bombarding you with ads so that it's actually annoying to open the app.",3
"I have made several attempts to deactivate my account and they refuse to deactivate. Beware before you sign up, it will take an act of God or a lawsuit to get this people to deactivate your account.",0
"This was a great app to you however it has been more annoying than useful to me as a truck driver. Pop-up windows I don't need, ads pop up all the time when I needed the most preventing me from using it.good luck!",2
Try to search for fuel in a certain city and gives me prices for places nowhere near the city I was Searching for,0
"Gps will send you to the wrong address then say to go through a fence, houses or forest to get to your destination. The last straw was when it sent me the other day 8 miles in the wrong direction and then said I had arrived at my destination.",0
Trash app....,0
Four pop up ads before it lets ypu use it. No thanks.,0
"Never able to reach the final destination with a big rig and keep asking for unlawful U-turn. Even if Google Map helps the destination, this trucker path keeps persuasively send us back to a wrong address...",4
Not worth the money And we'll take your money at your bank account after the 7 day free trial if you don't cancel it,4
Did doesn't show DOT spots like it used to anymore,0
Cancel this app is a run around trust me,0
this app has become awefull takes too long to load many error screens on availability and details. Update... This app has gone from aweful to highly frustrating... No longer useful for just getting a quick list of truck stops along a route. Have to constantly fight off the pop-ups for premium services and trials...stop it...I just need some fast information... If you are on a slow data connection...this app will not even work tho other apps will... I will be unistalling and using another.,3
I told them I did not want to pay for it any longer and still money is being taken out of my account. I did what I was told and still I get charged.... Not very happy right now,0
"While checking a status, something popped up quickly & subscribed me to diamond status. I tried to unsubscribe, but it just takes me to the app page in the Google Play Store. It does not even show up in my account for my subscriptions starting how much I will be charged when the free trial is over. Please cancel this subscription.",3
Paid truck routes,4
App is great. But I no longer need it. Uninstalled it. And thought I canceled my subscription by doing so. This morning it took the total amount out of my account. Need to be able to pause subscriptions,0
They sell your information. You will recieve spam phone calls if you give them your number.,0
Will not let you report fuel over 4.99gl so almost every fuel report is off,0
"fuel prices wont keep up with the economy, programming limits updates of overwhelming prices due to the war. so this app is unuable to find good fuel locations",4
Want to unsubscribe they charge me without my concern.,0
Always some problems with ...errors...I paid for Dimond Account they charge me via Google pay after 1week my account was blocked because they didn't upgrade my account but I was charged for it lol. When I contact Trucker Path they say they are very sorry but they can't do anything because I use Google pay and I have to contact Google. Google say they paid for Truckers Path and I should have my Dimond account to the app. So I contact Trucker Path again and nothing happens lol this app is a scam,4
Not a good app,3
Took money from my bank the 4th of the trial,0
You have to pay for the actual truck route map 🖕🏽,4
DO NOT TRUST FUEL PRICES IN THIS APP!!! Used to be a great app... Unfortunately truckstops have begun taking advantage of the ability to change fuel prices luring owner operators in after running fuel low to get to the stop for cheaper fuel. I've been all over the country and noticed this is happening every where. I have personally updated fuel prices and watched as the truck stop changed the price back to a false prices before i even left the fuel island!,4
Chinese company ... don't buy or download.,0
"I downloaded the app. I added my credit card information and it didn't allow me to access the truck routes. Meanwhile, it's trying to charge $150 to my credit card when it wouldn't work for the 7 free days. I want to unsubscribe.",4
Won't let me unsubscribe everytime I hit unsubscrive it brings be back to the Uninstall or open app screen in the play store. Please advise,2
"Trash, bloated, overpriced, not even functional trash",0
You can't navigate without pay,0
How do u cancel this subscription,3
Don't let u update your location,0
I want to cancel my subscription!!! But I'm having trouble find where to do so.!!!!!,3
They tried to take 900 from my account,0
Useless. Can't select to be weighing more than 90k. Move on and find something practical.,0
Wont let me unsubscribed keep telling me to make u-turns anybody that drives a rig know that you can make u-turns,4
"I think this app might be hacked, or something like that. I signed up for premium trial for truck routing and 4 days before I was supposed to be charged the app tried to charge $162 to my credit card through Google. Luckily my bank flagged it and I was able to deny the charge. Needless to say I will not be continuing my premium subscription.",0
"Totally broken for me now. GPS is useless for trip planning because everytime i try to route a trip it sets the origin point to some parts warehouse in Canada. Im in Colorado so, yea. No help. Dont know whats going on but ive tried everything and it still says im in Canada but the other maps on my phone is just fine.",2
"Iv had this downloaded for awhile now. I unstalled it cuz it was acting up. When I try to download it again, all it says is pending. So I can't get this bk on my phone? Can anyone from trucker path help me out?",4
"This app is a waste of time and money. It may take you on a truck route most times, it just taken me on a no trucks route. It takes you the least direct to your destination. I'll send the money and buy a truck gps system.",1
It is a scam they tell you you get one week free and then $9.99 a month and then they ran my card twice for $99 then they claim they can't do a refund because Google charged my account not them it is a scam do not use them they will steal money from you,0
"Not to bad, however it claims that roads are closed when they are not! Seems to want to send you long way around.. that's why I gave it a one star.",0
Freezing. Not showing proper way. Worst app I ever used. Ok thanks!,3
"I give it 1 star because it wasn't that easy to navigate the app, let alone quickly find the address bar to enter in a destination. I think avoiding weigh stations should be a routing option as well. The layout of the app is just not all that user friendly. I can see using this app as a supplement but definitely not my main mapping app and definitely not paying for the app.",1
How do i stop my diamond services. When I click unsubscribe it takes me back to play store to open the app I already was open to. There seems to be no customer service help options either. I'm stuck with paying subscription i dint want.,0
This used to be an okay app. But now you have to pay for truck navigation which is the main reason you'd get this app. Just use Hammer or Truck Map.,1
Poor,0
"'Truck route' part behind paywall, i could understand all the optimisations and all being behind the paywall but not the truck route part.",4
Routes and navigation are substandard. Will route you thought roads that are difficult to negotiate and restricted. App slows down after you pay. Save your money and buy a gps.,0
I got a better phone so the crashing stopped mostly but since I've been using it I've noticed a lot of key perks to having the app have been removed like th option to avoid weigh stations and multi route option,4
"The have 5 second full screen Ads that pop up when you launch the app, another full screen add when you close that one, another banner of ads at the bottom of the location details then they want a monthly subscription? HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND. ILL JUST USE MY GARMIN. UNINSTALLED Update, tries the app again and 4 ads pop up just after starting the app. Lol someone need to make a app to compete with this money grabbing pile of trash.",2
"While the developers did update this app to change my complaints, I can't give it more than one star. This app, despite stating it won't send you a non truck road, lead me down a path where railroad tracks ended up damaging my landing gear. Please, if you have the money, buy yourself a proper GPS and save yourself the headache.",3
signed up for the 7-day free trial don't like it and now I can't find the cancel button before they charge me.,4
"They don't know how to make real money to support the app... therfore it sucks..! Pay for this pay for that, give us your info.",2
Why have a diamond plan when it takes forever to load a route and the navigation in my opinion isn't any better than alternatives with less out of pocket pulling.,0
Stop charging for service that I haven't used in over 6 months,0
Won't let me unsubscribe,4
Not user friendly at all. Do not force me to click through nonsense.,0
"I switched to a free app heard about called HAMMER. Too many wrong directions and roads that are restricted to trucks. Have to reset and turn back on often, and then takes awhile for it to ready itself, a lit if putting in information all over again. Many times I ended up on a 2 lane road no where to turn around for about 20 plus miles. One time destination was less than quarter mile, before app sent me to turn away. I usually called ahead for directions sometimes had to rely on GPS.",0
This app would not let me cancel subscription and tried charging me $160.00 at 4 am in CA one night. BIG SCAM,3
How do i unsubscribe? There is no Do Not Charge Me or cancel option.,0
Constantly staying hung up on the previous exit I just took. Will not show truck stops while navigating. I really shouldn't have to hit navigate 4 times to start getting directions. Crashes my s7tab all the time,2
extremely danger to follow this map.I regert for using and subscribe it.,0
Is it me or is their response to everything is we fixed it update I think people rather hear/read I'm sorry thank for the feed back we will look in to it then update when it truly is fixed,0
Dishonest app. Nearly impossible to unsubscribe.,0
Navigation feature is completely useless. Probably the worst I've ever seen.,0
This program sucks dick,0
"I signed up for the monthly billing plan, with the 7 day free trial. They immediately charged my account for a full year's subscription that I didn't opt for. I am trying to speak with someone and they are impossible to get ahold of. I have read the plan and if I cancel they won't refund me... don't get this load board they will screw you out of money just like they did to me. Highly unprofessional for a company to completely disregard the package I wanted and charge me a full amount.",4
Last Three months useless. Always an error or gives me directions to complete different state. Waste of money.,0
Day by day this app getting worst. Being difficult for using. Not comfortable! So many buttonts and windows! I use this app only for truck stops and weigh stations. I don't need any more places on this app.,2
Couldn't even get right locations,0
"can't wait for an alternative, gets worst with almost every update",0
You should be ashamed for asking money for every single feature on the app. Can use anything for free. I have asked more truckers to give you guys one star. Just watch what happens :) Stop being greedy,1
"It took me down a back country road (only 15 feet wide only ment for 2 smart cars side by side) with twists, turns, ups, downs, low powerlines, and no where to turn around. DON'T download or waste your money on this app.",0
The app informations and reporting g of turn by turn navigation is inaccurate and delayed .,0
If I could give it a negative rating I would. Worst connectivity on the planet. I'd be better off with a Garmin. How can you call yourself and navigation app if you can't connect anywhere?,0
"Updated: I've used this app for just over 2 years. Mostly for the convenience of seeing truck stops and rest areas along my route. Navigation is horrible, and I do mean horrible. Tries to have you go down residential streets, u-turns, etc.... make sure you zoom out to look at your route before you follow the route. Additionallly, ALWAYS having some kind of issue with app. For instance, right now you can't even pull up an address. If I need to use Google for navigation, why am I paying you?",1
If you are in ladero and you put fortworth texas like destination this will send you to PA,0
"Trucker Path s refusing to issue a refund sfter charging me 6 months which is $162.00 for a app that didnt work well for me. The gps was slower then i was driving and it may have been my phone, but the issue is i have not received a refund and only neen told to have google refund the monies which google doesnt do it is the responsibility of the developer. Do yourself a favor and get a app with better customer service you will thank me later.",0
Stop trying to force people to buy the gold or diamond package when they try to use the free version yall have really ruin this app tried to give it another chance just take it off the play store if your just gonna ruin whatever left of it,0
I deleted app accidentally. Now it won't take my password and the link it keeps sending me to reset it says. Error. How do I get my gold membership back I payed for. And reset my password,0
This app was a great app but the past year it's been nothing short of a disaster! There trying to be more than they need to be! Just point out the truck stops and weigh stations let the load board stuff up to a way better and more reputable app,4
What is going on with the app Every time you kick on a location it says loading and then error happens. Un install and reinstall but the same thing happens come on trucker path let's see if we can get I fixed,4
Once upon a time...but it's just a mass of loading error...read recent reviews b4 downloading,0
I've been using this app for several years now all the sudden I cannot get updates on weigh stations anymore if they are open or not. Uninstall and reinstall the app and keeps just saying error error,1
Always an error when updating status now!,0
"app is not working properly.. im trying to find a parking, but is not showing me any information about it",0
Very slow! Tells me they can't find almost all cities I put in. Very frustrating!!!,0
Scamers stealing your personal information and sharing it with Scamers everywhere; the support team is not responding .,0
If you get this cancel the free trial right away they charged me a $140 in 4 different payments in the 1st month.,4
Is not for free.👎,0
Won't let me Unsubscribe from the app.,4
I tried the app found it wasn't easy to use and I only needed it for one trip I was charged 150.00 dollars 7 days later so I canceled my subscription and Google is refusing to give me my money back do not sigh up for anything in this app 150.00 dollars is way to much to pay when I only used this app for 3 days,0
"Waste of money. For $250 per year you'll hear an annoying female voice that will have you going around in circles around Layton, Utah and will get you lost in Texas. It will try to make you take residential areas and make a u turn many times. There's better options.",0
So so disappointed with this app I tried on my iPad I tried on my tablet I tried on my iPhone and all it would do is freeze I would even turn off my device and when I turned it on it would be frozen so so so disappointed I'm out I'm going to get a Garmin or mc Nally,0
They made a new update where Everytime you press something a giant ad pops up that can only be removed by pressing the back button on your phone. I see this ad about 10 times per minute. Extreamly abnoxious and a very stupid move on the developers end. Sadly they have the menopoly on this service but I will look out for another app to compete with them.,1
This used to be a decent app... Now the frequency of ads appear every time you navigate in the app... Whomever they hired to do this should be sent packing... The nonsubscribers represent an integral usability to the app by providing useful updates to scales and such. Clearly they do not understand our community thus I'll be uninstalling and my recommendation is to pass and if you do have it to uninstall app...,0
Impossible to use without purchasing an 8-10 dollars a month plan. Prompts pop up so you can not see the map. Was working great a few weeks ago.,0
I have been using this app for years and now you can't get any information without the subscription being shoved down your throat. It really sucks because you get 10 popups for trying their services and can't even see the screen you want. Really has gone downhill. Uninstalled it. I will find another way.,1
new update makes it unusable. started at 12/31/21. pop up covering whole screen asking to start 7 day trial. Will pop up every 3 sec even if you close it. Can not use as a free app anymore.,1
The stupid ad for premium is always popping up now they must not be getting enough ad revenue,0
Sucks like usual and why pay it to much money,0
$300 a year and they insist on having your phone number so they can sell your info to spammers! I can buy a real GPS that will last for years rather than paying $300 every year for this. Using hammer app instead and it works great without the extra hassles,0
Have me making uturns alot and going wrong way,0
Didnt like it.,0
Stole 169 dollars out of my account and they not giving it back 😤😔🤧,0
This app sucks,0
The app fraudulently overcharged me thru Google and I'm fighting to get refunded,0
Don't try getting a refund the buck just gets past back and forth from Google to trucker to Google. What a scam. I will not be purchasing anything from Google again. Any time I tried the app after the free trail I'm lucky if it works properly. It shure work during the free trail. Stick to garmin or rand McNally,0
"For the love of God, give us an option to turn off the auto pop up for what our loading status is............. I'm just trying to look for dang parking, I don't use this app for loads... fix that I'll rate 5*...",2
Couldn't use unless you buy a plan. Ugh,0
"Not worth it, to expensive cheaper to buy a regular window gps for trucls",0
How can a truck GPS advise UTurns. Like. Come on,2
Do not sign up for free trial!!!! It's almost impossible to get out of it and hard to stop or get money back !!!!! Not worth the extra money anyways,4
"So if I type in Sheldon, IA. 51031 and sends me to California that's a no for me dog",0
Stupid sends you down wrong roads and tells you to make a U turn in a 53 foot truck stupid,0
"Insane amount of data usage coupled with crashes when I change time zones. If you add in the fact it reverts from mapvto satellite mode frequently, I think I will be canceling subscription for overdryve. The only positive is keeping me on truck routes, though it frequently changes my desired route.",4
If u decide like myself to cancel account they make it hard to do so.,0
"Won't let me cancel subscription been 4 months, and can't find contact number",3
"Signed up for the 7-day free trial, instantly got charged $30 for the month. Used the satellite view to test it out, looked at my house so I would know how recent the imaging was posted, they are using satellite images from over 4 years ago, I wouldn't trust it if you need to look for an entrance to a DC. Also, I don't know if I'd trust the directions if they are using old data. Just my experience and two cents.",2
Way to much money... I been trying to cancel and they won't let me,4
Trash you have to pay for,0
Why are you a trucking navigation app if you have to pay for truck navigation. You're an idiot if you pay for their service this app is easily replaced by Google search and Google Maps.,1
FRAUD!! WILL NOT CANCEL. They work as a small group explaining a cancelation takes review by different departments then you just don't hear back. In regards to why I canceled the app doesn't work any better than Google maps with the dimension of your truck. I do not recommend this app or the company. They did not cancel my subscription and continue to charge me over a year later. I have now listed their charge as fraudulent twice.,3
"""Finding truck stops near you"" I'm in Oregon. The truck stops *near me* are NOT IN WISCONSIN.",2
"Issues and they shorten paid memberships. First I didn't want to pay for it. Somehow on their ""ad"" i must have clicked the wrong button. Paid $150 ish Wich I thought was for a year. 6 months later it's cancelled. Terrible",0
"Useless, will say ""some spots"" available, which means paid spots ($15-20) app doesn't differentiate between free and paid spots, so what me and my many trucker friends from my blog do...is the opposite. If a truck stop says many spots, we will mark the truck stop FULL, if it's full, we will say there are MANY SPOTS available....we hope it screws up this bogus app and makes it useless, ha ha ha",0
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! It is glitcy and impossible to cancel your subscription. I've canceled twice and it keeps charging me. Beware...,3
Retarded that you have to pay for a membership just to navigate to your destination I mean in that case just charge from the apple/play store from the beginning and don't make us waste our time downloading and finding out that you have to pay from the start... don't waste your time on this app unless you tryna pay a monthly subscription.,1
I paid $30 and still can't see weight station prediction and avoid option on my app. So I open another account another same story. always problems no customers service too call. When i chat with them. They said they are sorry but they can't refund my money because of they policy. Don't waste your money,0
"Paying this app to see diesel prices and it shows none. Doesn't show any new updates, unstalled the app and install it again and still nothing.",0
Overpriced Garbage,0
You have to pay to start navigation,0
"Annoying voice, talks too fast and will run you down the wrong exit, if they're close together.",0
The $30.00 per month fee for commercial drivers is cost prohibitive. There's no way that I could afford it.,0
I've been paying for this app for over 2 years. It has recently come to the point of not working at all. Why am I paying for this???,1
"Slow, buggy, unreliable navigation.",0
How do you even cancel this POS? I click unsubscribe and it takes me to this Google play store page! What kind of scam are you running??,0
I use it on android phone. I pay for this app long time and there is no more avoid weight station options. And that was only reason why im was payig for. Gonna cancel probably,3
It's just a gps that's it. I need an app that provides hands free driving mode options like Google maps this app doesn't provide the same comfort when driving and needs to be updated for driving mode options. And when I unsubscribe it should do just that not take me to the app then charge me for a service I'm not satisfied with.,3
"Full of bugs. Updates only make problems worse. Worst 30 dollars monthly you can spend. Horrible lagged guidance. Goodluck using other ""features"" that don't work or load 75% of the time. 1 out of every 7 addresses don't show on map but on any other GPS they do. Horribly outdated map interface, frequently wrong and months behind road construction.",0
Keep trying to cancel my account and it won't cancel!,0
"the updated app wants access to your photos, media and other things. FOR WHAT?!!! Im uninstalling. (updated 3/27/19) Im afraid to get the newest updated based on the reviews ALONE!! I used to be able to put in my destination without an acct but YOU MUST have one in order to plan your trip. I am not giving this app any permissions. Not sure why the developers feel this is necessary NOW when it NEVER was an issue.",0
"I tried it, did not like it. I Uninstalled the app but trucker path charged me 270$ some how. I want a refund . Never clicked or saw anything about free trail, much less pay for an app that did not work for me. To many FREE apps out there !!!!!",3
Considering deleting app since now they want location at all times. Please don't answers my review saying this isn't the case as I've seen other complaints of the same nature.,0
"This app has suddenly started asking me to enable my location all the time. I have no interest in giving anyone access to my location 24 hours a day. Why does this app keep asking me to enable my location all the time? It blocks the map with this large square asking me to enable location all the time.***Your reply makes no sense. I just told you it is constantly asking for full time location. Your reply is that I constantly click ""later"" every time it constantly asks my location.",0
It was a great ap 4 yes ago it seems every time it updates it gets worse 😕 I rarely use it,0
The paid version sucks!! I have a Samsungs21. It crashes won't show fuel prices along route (only sometimes). And the navigation doesn't give you accurate information.. i hope they fix this I paid for 6 months!!!!,4
"Why do I pay monthly if weigh station prediction and ""avoid"" option doesn't work anymore ?",2
So much more needs to be done make this app good like able to click on icons for exits to see the numbers and not be so small then there are bridge weights that should be shown . Tons more needs to be available,0
This app is sucking more and more everytime ai go to use it ....seems like unless you pay for it your getting basic b.s. which gives you the same mapping as Google and well if you unblock me from downloading ill give it another try and give u a nother rating,0
Getting nothing but arrow code after arrow code ever since I did the last update today. Normally I'm bragging about this app.,0
"Been a paid subscriber for over a year, and sadly this app only seems to be getting worse. Currently it's neither returning any search results/addresses, and then after re-installing the app thinking it might solve the issue, it refuses to allow me to login, thereby making my subscription worthless. Edit: It seems as of November 2021, this app is broken. Several other reviewers have posted having similar issues.",0
Having some issues since update. The app kicked me out and I am no longer able to login or get directions,3
"Uninstalling and cancelling subscription, can't even login anymore, complete BS",0
Constant malfunctions very unreliable services,0
I can't login!!!!! I'm on the road!!!! You bustards!!!! No help!!!!! I paid you for service!!!! Phone hungs all the time you asking something!!!! With your f...ng popups!!! On the middle of the turn or in difficult situation!!!! I paid for not worrying me with your f..ng questions!!!! It's dangerous for driving!!!! Remove this fiature or give me a chose to disable your questions!!!!!,0
Constant errors constant shut downs... Won't even show def nor fuel prices anymore,4
"App doesn't work after update. Why should I pay for the app which is not working? ""Report us"" doesn't work!!!!",3
Terrible app. Very buggy and demands to onow location 24/7. I have to allow them to know where i am even when i am off work? No WAY!! Look elsewhere.,0
How do I get in touch with someone about this app? We are being double charged for it. It is set up to where its added to our Verizon bill and im paying it that way but they are also pulling it directly out of our bank account! Really like using this app but I need my money back from being double charged like this! This is ridiculous!,1
Horrible app will ask you to pay for it first before you can use it to get directions,0
Terrible,0
"App lugging I paid per month and not happy with it . If you get it don't buy it, use it for free only !!!",0
Was good last update has it all completely messed up. Please go back to the last version,0
This used to be a good app. Its now gone to hell. It will change your route if you stop or answer the phone. This is without your knowledge or permission. Dont trust this app. It also cannot find many addresses or takes you to the complete wrong place. Unsubing.,3
"Not worth the $. Now, how do I cancel?",0
"Absolutely terrible instructions. Exits wrong (154B != 154). Apparently every HOV entrance and exit is a whole separate highway worthy of an instruction to keep right using any available lane... ... But the best Impossible turns even with ""No harsh turns"" activated.

"""Trucker"" Path, but don't worry because if you're a trucker you have to pay $300/YEAR. That part used to be free, now you have to pay for it, change the name of your app. Your disgraceful to the entire trucking community. I won't come back even if it is free again, greed has ruined you.",4
What happened after this most recent update? Now I can't see the mileage or time of arrival anymore. It's like it's whited out. I pay $10 a month for this application and it needs to function properly. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it again. Running Android 12 on a Google pixel 3. Please get this figured out.,2
I don't want it and don't need it.,0
Usually a good app but latest update they ask to track your location 24/7 even when apps closed whenever you open the app or use the center on self button.,3
Never loaded once I input the address,0
"I can't give zero stars or I would, this app sucks, it's not user-friendly and it lags something awful, I would recommend any other navigation at but this one in fact I would recommend get an atlas and planning your trip that way before using this app",0
"I don't know what they did, but there doesn't seem to be a way to cancel a route and back out of the route screen anymore. My app has been stuck on one route because there's no way to clear it.",2
Absolute garbage Hammer is a way better app.,0
It's not safe in areas where network is spotty. How do I unsubscribe? Freezes constantly... It only works when it wants to. I can't believe I am paying for this useless thing. I will be looking for an alternative. Freezes after each us. Right now I am parked because it can't navigate. It's frozen. I have tried restarting the phone and the app several times - nothing. I am a truck driver. This is nonsense.,2
Do not get or use this app I need a app for a couple days agreed to pay a couple dollars then get billed for $160 asked for return then tryed stopping payment they fought back and won. I didn't even use the app 1 week and all it did is tell me false info of crashs roll over and cops probably other people they ripped off fasly reporting think ill join them,2
"Poor... Cancelled this app, a day too late... Won't get a refund... 100 bucks down the drain",0
No trial.,0
"This app was suggested to me, but don't use if for business. The GPS guided me to location that what nowhere near the actual address and following it's directions caused me to have a load canceled. Buy a real GPS and don't miss out on money plus save yourself the headache.",0
Not to good keep loosen the app keeps going out,3
"This app has really taken a turn for the worst! When I pull the app up on the map screen, ALL I WANT TO SEE IS WHAT I HAVE SELECTED TO SEE! Everytime the screen is touched it automatically pulls up a screen from the bottom, when you try to get it to go away, it goes full screen. REALLY SUCKS when you are trying to select an icon to check parking availability or to see if a scale is open or not. WOULD GIVE 0.0001 OF A STAR IF I COULD!",0
It won't let me cancel my subscription,3
Ok,0
Chanrged me for Gold subscription wothout approval. Dishonest app and conpany download.,0
This app sucks👎....fuel prices are not accurated...30cent off,4
Was good to find truck stops and info but ended up being one big ad for their premium membership,2
Awful,0
Worst interface ever,0
"As a otr driver this use to be my go to app but not anymore. I don't know why you ""fixed"" what wasn't broken but I'm done! App is totally useless now.",2
Disappointed seems to never offer shortest/fastest truck route without entering additional stops along my preferred shortest route.,4
"Everything else is great but the maps, NOT at all.",0
Can't even download it.,0
It sucked did not like it as much as copilot,0
They've made cancelling your subscription too freaking difficult!,0
Why wont it install on my phone. Android galaxy? Had it on here befor,0
Must cancel ❌❌❌ stop service,0
"Don't waste your money with this app. The truck stop, rest area, and weigh station feature is great, but the gps sucks. The first route I tried is one I drive regularly and know the way to get there just fine in a semi. Well this app wanted me to go an hour out of my way bc it didn't recognize a state route that trucks drive everyday all day. It wants you to stick to solely interstate type roads and we all know that's not always possible nor is it time or cost efficient. Find another app guys.",2
"This app is hot garbage, do not get until it's patched. I decided to try this app for hours of service optimization and for route navigation and this is by far the most expensive and worst quality app out there. God forbid if you miss an exit in a metropolitan area because by the time it updates the route you've missed the exit that it suggests. It looks like a GPS app, but smells like road kill skunk. The community features are cool but navigation is unusable",0
"I'm only writing this review to let other know it won't let you cancel your trial once you're done. I'm not sure if this is happening to others, but this could happen to you.",4
Keep logging me out,0
This app has to many issues dropping GPS signal and freezing.,0
The free version sucks. I've heard that the paid ones are good but I'm not going to pay for it.,0
This app really has become USELESS AS USELESS CAN BE!!! It really was a nice ap about 5 years ago. It was clean overlooking and simple to use!! No its the opposite of it!!,0
Way too expensive for me,0
"Needs a lot of work. If you are looking for a navigation app that is buggy, will force close while navigating, and route you to the wrong location; then you've found your app. Install for a frustrating and confusing experience.",0

Too complicated you're always trying to make me buy something that that I do not want to buy,0
For weight stations... what happened to the stats.... error message....,0
Is there an alternative to this application? This thing is littered with adds. They are killing this app again took away statistics feature.,0
Used this app a long while now all the sudden vant see weigh stations,0
"This app used to be great. Now you can't see recent comments anymore, you can't see previous stats of the weigh stations, even if you post a comment is not showing up. They limited so many features because they want you to subscribe. $9/month is way to much for what you guys offer. You trying to be Google maps, DAT 360 and much more. We pay DAT360 because is a reliable source for loads, you can't be that, never will be. Slow down, you started as a weigh station status app, be best at that.",3
It used to be okay and easy to use. It's too complex now I don't want to run trips through every time I open it.,0
"Trip map isn't separate anymore instead of just hitting the back button to the overall map you have to clear the trip just to look for any pins not on your route. Pointless ui ""upgrade.""",0
Horrible takes you on restricted roads do not reccomend,0
Doesnt work correctly,0
The app. Does what it's supposed to do. Unfortunately it charged me for a gold subscription I dodnt sign up for or apprv. Support is zero help. They put it on google. And Google apparently has no humans. I want this foxed!,0
nan,0
How do I get a refund I canceled my account must not do it Wright money was taken out of my account,0
Tried it. It tried to take me on two restricted routes. This app is not reliable.,0
Why would I agree to pay when you give me an app that's slow freezes n crashes. I've no complaints about the user interface or its features. The original free one is all I was looking for initially. Now 😡 it's making my work frustrating.. no my phone isn't the problem.. refund me. N use me for beta. I like this app the reason I'm here rather than just delete it.,3
Was a joke,0
Suxs,0
Not good trial then cancell they still $29 charged,0
slows down your phone by 7 seconds. shots off,0
"Broken now, does not work",0
Rated 4.3 for a reason,0
New update is absolutely horrible. Doesn't deserve your consideration at this point.,1
Crashes all the time. Sometimes while reading a review or while trying to search for a truck stop. Certainly a planned design flaw.,0
"Why this app doesn't show the recent weigh station updates?? It shows the updates from 2 days ago.. how are we supposed to help each other??? And what's the point of this app if doesn't have information we need??? Currently I am looking at the weigh station in Gallup New Mexico. It only shows the update someone left 2 days ago. Even though people do it people do it few times per hour. This blows. But you always on point with your ads, I guess this is all about ads for you, right?",2
"Guys don't forget your 7 days trial to cancel before due, they don't refund the $99.99 It's horrible.",0
It was working fine. But now that I updated it. It's not giving me the right location where I want to go.I'm putting in information for Maryland and it's taking me to Texas.,0
In order for me to get the complete information I need off of this app I have to pay for the service and I don't think that's right I want one that gives me all the information and tells me exactly how to go without charging me,0
"Major improvements have been made, less ads, still reliable when I need a truck stop, or to check weigh stations, or even truck GPS. Thanks for listening to your customers and removing those intrusive video ads. Still pop-ups while driving.",2
"So sad that you have to pay money to be able to see a trucker route, 99.99 a year and 299 dollars a year for diamond members, thats to much",0
constantly telling me there's an error and will not load anything.,0
After update app shows error all the time,3
"Crashes constantly, slow as can be, works when it wants to. Can't call anyone to assist. Uses A LOT of data and battery causes phone to get extremely hot. It's handy if it wants to work but that's a big if.",0
The app kept killing my phone.,0
"Off the bat you have to purchase this app before use. Judging by the reviews I'll pass 🙅‍♂️😆 How about you let the consumer try out the app before you go charging the consumer first before we even get a feel of it. Like I said, judging by the reviews I'll major pass on this app.",1
"This is your worst update ever. After trying to find a certain brand of TS. Can't figure out how to shut the filter off. So I can see all icons. The version with the tabs to see parking availability & weigh stations open or closed. Was by far the best version you have ever released. OLD:With more & more truckstops offering both paid & free parking. A 4th choice for parking is needed. ""only paid spaces left""",4
More aggravating than it's worth,0
This Horrible GPS takes you down dead end roads and Non truck roads. Tells you to turn after you pass your turn. The computer generated voice sounds like someone speaking with food in their mouth. Would not recommend.,0
Put it back to the way it was where you don't have to be routed at all times,0
To many ads pushes the paid service to much just use hammer instead hammer free to use doesnt try to push you to buy trash,0
"This is supposed to be a truckers app but the dang routes it gives is for cars and if you want the truck route you have to pay for it! Regardless of the trucking industry being over 70,000 truck drivers short, truck drivers don't make a helluva lot of money especially to be spending it on an app that should be free. A FREE app to help us chart a truck route to our destination would be very helpful. To the designer of this app, everything you own or touch everyday was brought to you by a truck!",4
Money,0
Can't open. Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra,0
Extremely offensive advertisements,0
"GPS doesn't work half the time, useless. Got it to try for the seven days, forgot to cancel, got charged for the year subscription and they don't refund. Stay away from this scam.",0
Can't even unsuscribe. Just takes u directly to the app over and over again!!!!,0
Y'all took out the fuel optimization. Subscription cancelled,0
"After the free 7 day trial it started to have to many tech issues. Took me out of route several times costing me hours!!! Never worked properly when needed , didn't give same or even close directions for addresses visited previously. Horrible app do not purchase.",0
No good,0
Ruined it.,0
Has not been a good one so far.,0
"Just bring back the old version of this app, this version is worthless trying to charge even though truckers do all the work by updating all statuses. With every update comes more disappointment.",0
I'm trying to cancel my membership and am unable to do so,0
This new update is garbage cant find diesel prices made it more difficult to use,1
So I can't get the update. It just keeps saying pending. Really bad time for this to happen.,0
Signed up for a monthly subscription but the charged me for the whole year.,0
Pure garbage. Hard to use and the interface is trash.,0
"So, it's a free app specifically aimed at truck drivers, but to get truck routes, you must pay. Nice free trucker app.",4
Very low expectations! Not worth the investment,0
Drivers this app has completely gone to the trash. They have cluttered up the screen and now it's all crazy messed up. Going to try another app.,0
I paid you guys for your goal plan and it doesn't work or open you keep sending me a link so I can reset my password but it does not work how can I get my money back,0
"Terrible app, Stops working in the middle of route, then wants you to reset in the middle of route. Sends you down no truck roads. Very bad for your money",0
Keep getting unknown after I start a trip.,0
Charges for dark mode,0
App totally stopped working after latest update. I'm canceling my monthly membership and buying new GPS,3
not working.,0
Navigate does not work anymore. Im a gold member for many months now and even subscribed for premium thing that would solve the issue but still not working. Its up to date and I have tried on multiple devices but it wont work anywhere.,0
"I bin used this GPS for one month, twice per week this thing freezing on me, now I'm heading to Houston got three stops, that thing stops working last night. I updated this morning, still not working. Also it's asking about weight stations status on I-80 in PA, its very distinctive.",0
"This last update was wrong... I want previous version of this app. I needed that sections with Diesel prices, parking spot, and open weigh stations... Now it doesn't have it... it's useless...",4
"I bought it to use as a GPS and it works really bad, don't buy it for that reason.",0
Navigation does not work anymore I tried uninstalling and restarting nothing works,0
"App runs very slow, if it works at all",0
Very first road it tried to navigate to doesn't exist. Off to a bad start,0
Shuts down when I need it most. Consistently puts me on non truck roads. app is one big POS.,0
It doesn't work any more,0
"""Creat new trip"" not working 🤬🤬🤬",0
"Keeps crashing my phone!!! First the app crashes then it crashes my phone. I have asked support to help but I get nothing but runaround emails with no help other than the Tylenol fix ""clear cash and restart your phone""...SERIOUSLY??? EVERY SINGLE TIME??? I need a refund or fix QUICK!!! I have the pro subscription and THIS is what I get??? It would be ZERO stars if possible...",0
"Not good at all. Constantly brings you to wrong locations. You get sent on unnecessary detours and through small streets. It brings you the longer way every time. I started using a different GPS app and that app shaves off about 20- 40 minutes minutes compared to this one. For $10 a month, this app isn't worth it. There are way better ones out there",0
"App wants u to tap multiple things to update weigh stations, were drivers...not supposed to be on the phone while driving!!!!",4
When updated. It stopped working,0
Worked okay as my backup GPS. Started acting weird a few months ago. Now the GPS doesn't work at all. Have contacted them and get no reply. I want my money back.,0
Ok I paid 30 bucks for this app and it ain't working it's a piece of s***,0
It stops when you need it the most.,0
Download the update for the app.. App is 100% unusable and can no longer find any locations.,3
"iOS and Android FAILS when it's most important. You're on a highway with multiple ways to be lost, or you're in tight tough neighborhood with truck restricted roads, or you're just trying to make it on time in the morning. This freaking app just FAILS.",0
App has decided it no longer wants to work. Can't route anywhere all of a sudden.,0
Most of the time is not working and I can't even redeem my points,0
Payed for the map for 3 months the app dropped it's signal often and at the worse time possible would have given it 2 stars but I cancelled my subscription with 2 weeks of payed subscription left the app would only say .... CAN'T FIND A WAY THERE... useless in tight situations but decent for interstate hiways but not inner city,0
Keeps freezing up not sure why I keep paying for something that doesn't work properly all the time 🙄😤😤😡😡😡😡,0
Poor,0
Why did my subscription end before the 1st?,0
Stay crashing!! Will have you stuck in the middle of no where. Get a secondary GPS just in case this one acts up!!,0
"Still from time to time I cannot route because of ""DATA ERROR!"" and IT WANTS ME TO DOWLOAD MORE DATA BUT THERE ISN'T A WAY TOO! However, now the routing part is giving better total time estimates. [10-08-2019] I an cancelling the monthly. Why? Support is non existent and the problems are not fixed. [08-30-2021] From ok to bad to worse. That is the progress with each update. Bloat may be the problem. I try other sources before this now. It takes up to 15 minuetes before sites show on the map!",0
This app is garbage. It won't even let me unsubscribe from its premium.,4
My experience with this app as a business owner. I would not recommend this app to any business owner that wishes to be listed. But thankfully they have finally removed my business from the app. Don't say you were not warned.,3
30$ a month? You are nuts,0
Horribly useless unless you buy the app.,0
Crashes all the time.,0
margate bridge nj has a 12.2 height restriction 20000 lbs. weight restriction. your app had me go this route ....thanks ...,0
"Garbage gps app. Useful for some things like finding parking or seeing if lots are full. Gps wise though it's trash, don't know how many times I've left the app when I'm filling up on fuel and I go back to the app and it's rerouted me and I only notice after being on the wrong route for 20 miles.",2
No ability to dial in truck weight height length etc & nothing but hate from the clown cult on the msg board. Save your time & hard earned $ dont download this,0
Nothing works anymore it's so buggy gos doesn't work half the time. It's dangerous and can get you lost if you don't pay very close attention,0
"Its Paid for trucks, It shows car routes that I can also see on goolge maps, for truck navigations, its paid.",0
I don't know why you guys did this but since the last update you made this app virtually unusable. Used to be i could see which scales are open on my entire route with a birds eye view. Red or green. Now I gotta click on each one separately because they are all green otherwise. And the user interface has become more complicated. No one uses this app as a GPS. We all wanna just see the scales and truckstops. That's why I paid the fee. Please bring back the old functions and stop messing with it,2
Cancel my subscription,3
"It's not ready for prime time. This software feels more like a late alpha or early beta. When planning a trip with multiple stops, it sometimes has a tendency to re-order the stops into a not logical order. I try to reorder them back and it often won't let me set them to where they need to be. I usually have to clear the whole trip out and create the plan anew. Sometimes it tries to route me back to a previous stop. After I tried one last time to view the trip plan to get ETA for today's stops, it scrambled them again. Also, it uses Google Speech for spoken directions. This is significantly quieter than music if provided on the same device and there doesn't seem to be any way to fix that.",4
"Used this app for a cross country move to make navigation easier in a rental truck. Immediately troubled by the app being unresponsive and laggy: Navigating the menus was difficult because pressing a button did nothing for a good few seconds Navigation would freeze and lose location with no warning Adding stops to a trip was painful, the interface does not indicate if stops are on the correct side of a highway.",0
Takes me down roads I cant go down with a truck also takes me 1-2 exits past my destination to turn around and go to place it would be good if it worked,0
Trucker's PATH-ETIC!!,0
I need to unsuscribe please I don't need this app anymore.,2
Terrible,0
Reading reviews while installing...i will be uninstalling now.,0
How do I cancel the 7 day free trial? Very malicious to prevent a person from cancelling.,4
I canceled 3 days into my free trial yet I'm still getting charged $31. Avoid this app.,4
"I downloaded the app to use as a trucking specific navigation tool. The app crashed at least 5 times in the first hour. I had been warned by my brother that it would crash but wanted to try it out. It also slowed my Samsung Tab A 8 down to the speed of a slug in molasses? Don't waste your time or money, maybe one day there will be a good alternative to a dedicated trucking GPS. It look like I'll be buying a Garmin.",1
"I'm not extremely happy with this program thus far, half the time it doesn't even know where I'm at the country the other day I looked for a truck stop and it said it was only 1,465 mi away and take me 20 some hours to get there, the idea is supposed to be to find a truck stop near my location and no I have no vpns or anything weird like that installed on my phone, just one day at work the next day it didn't",0
"Got sucked into paying almost $400 Canadian for this app and it is garbage. Went and found a new app which is my favourite four letter f word...FREE!!! It's a far better version of what you're getting here for $0, it's called Hammer. And you don't have to put up with webcam girls pretending to be female truckers trying to get your attention and money.",0
It is NOT in real time. I had a 7 day free trail period. I was busy driving for a living and cancelled on day 8. I asked for a refund through the app and google play and it was denied. I guess I just threw $30 in the garbage.,0
"The app freezes, new version is even worse",1
Soso and to much expensive.,0
"Says it's ""one free app"" but you can't even navigate without paying. Shady. Response: App description says ""Best of all, we’re FREE to download! All your trucker tools (trucker map) in one free app."" But the most important feature is only available if you pay.",0
Pain in the ### hard to use new update,1
Challenging to cancel your membership.,0
I was told the Gold price was 99 per year and charged 129. Cancelled subscription because no one got back to me.,0
"The app may work reasonably well, but the refund that is supposed to come for a one-week free trial has never showed up!!! I canceled the subscription two days after using it. I had tried this back in December and thought maybe they had improved it, but no it's not been improved. I sent two emails asking for a refund two days after installing but no response and no refund. It was supposed to be a 7-Day free trial.! Google says that the refund must be sent thru YOU, the developer.",4
Useless app if nobody is going to update.,0
Advertises as a map app for truckers but you have to pay $30 a month for it,0
"App is called Trucker Path, but only free for Cars, Truckers have to pay for premium access for truck paths, lol ummmm ok. Edit: I am a Trucker, if you need funds to support features then you need to charge 4 wheel vehicles as well. Do the regular features not need funds to maintain?",4
Qpp doesn't work. Says network error no route when I have full 4g and Google maps works. I have given it full permissions. Useless app.,0
"Not free, only does car routes for free... Use Google maps",1
Always crashes.,0
Can't get it to download,0
Crashes all the time... trying to reinstall now to see if that fixes the issue as my co-worker uses this app with no issues!,0
All I want to do is cancel gold membership but the stupid app won't let me. Uninstalling and using a different app since customer service is not one of your strong suits.,4
Wow upsell much? Just make the app a purchase and save us all the headache of downloading a mostly useless free app. Didn't try the paid options because....why would I?,0
"I have been using this app for several years and have loved it. Over the weekend, they changed it. I now have NOTHING I had before, and I have to shell out 24 usd a month for the privilege. I am royally ticked off here. They screwed it up. Nothing is intuitive, navigation loops back on itself to redundant questions and blocks access to maps. I updated to the newest version. Worse. They need to put it back to the version that was useful two weeks ago, then LEAVE IT ALONE!Utter stupidity. Goodbye.",1
"Was automatically charged and didn't want this app after trying free trial, it was taking me thru none trucking routes",4
"This app should honestly be free, it's practically useless for professional drivers with a year or more of experience and it can easily be replaced by a combination of common sense, google maps and the fuel apps out there (such as Love's or flying J/pilot). Overpriced and obsolete after a few months.",1
Navigation is terrible! Can't trust it or distances. Tried too opt out before I'm charged but not sure that even worked. What a headache.,0
I used this app on one trip.For most of the run it was either froze up or completly wrong on the route.Dont use it buy a garmin.,0
This app is not made for Canada . He will take you to wrong address some times won't find your adrs and will take you the wrong direction wasted me time and but me to wrong old farm road I back up 3 hours almost when he take me to the wrong direction please don't use it Canada if you wanna be safe,0
"I will be deleting the app after this review. I Used to use Trucker Path as my sole source for finding truck stops and getting routing. Because it Used to redirect to Google maps, which was Awesome. But with the most recent update it no longer does that with out Paying for it. Sorry I'm not gonna pay for that.",2
ive used this and it keeps rerouting me...this app sucks,0
Misleading navigations most of the time.,0
"Useless. I used to be able to find truckstops and available parking but like another ex-user stated it does neither now, just shows a map.",0
Used to work great. Then they made it better and it no longer shows any stops at all..go back to the old version. Who wants to pay for an app that don't work.,3
Garbage no point in having an app that doesn't work. In reply to your questions nothing works on your app just fusses out freezes ads junk nothing works just like all the rest of the reviews in here The app is junk,3
Can't download,0
This app used to be the gold standard for truck drivers. Over the last 4 years it's gotten worse and worse. As of July/21 they have it blocked from connecting to Google maps so you are forced to pay for their 3rd rate Truck routing. I would have gladly bought this outright year's ago but because they insist on a monthly fee they've never gotten a penny from me.,3
"What happened to the truck stops on the map, it doesn't show any that defeat the purpose",2
Had to reinstall a few weeks ago because it wouldn't open. Now it opens but refuses to tell me the location of any truck stops,2
"Not a good experience at all. The App looks great and all the stuff it provides seems awesome.....but it would not work on my Asus 9.7"" Android 7 tablet with a Verizon data card.....it always shows me off the road and says it can't receive data. Then try to cancel your free trial.....good luck!",0
Use to be a good app and definitely was my go - to to use but after numerous occasions of having to re-enter destination information JUST TO GET IT TO WORK and other glitches enough is enough especially when I had a paid subscription.,3
DOT is having remove open updates and reviews showinf bears are there. Do not trust thia app anymore.,0
"Where did all the scales go?! It shows the major ones on the interstate, but nothing on the highways",0
"Really!? 29.99 per month now. Nope. Just another one trying to take advantage of us. App doesn't work half the time. Parking spots out of date. Or not real time availability. ( some spots 11 days ago)GPS is horrible and unsafe for truck routing, thats when it can find my location mostly it freezes and gets stuck. Drivers, get the little book for $5 that gives u all parking nationwide. Kill this greedy app.",3
Well it use to work good But lately not so good Its not showing any parking or truck stops. It gets old having to reinstall trucker path again and again Update: I down loaded the app again and still no truck stops showed up. It just shows the highways. Ive click on the icons to what im looking for. It still shows me nothing.,2
Last week I had no problems... this week they want me to pay for it....yall used Google for your maps which was free anyways...sucks you had to make it to where you had to pay.....,0
I had daimond plan but still it took me from longest way and under tinny bridges.,0
Updates making this app worse and worse to find a truck stop. 😡,0
CSR not helpful in cancelling subscription,0
$300 a year!? 😂 Why would anyone pay this when a trucker gps will do the same thing for a 1 time payment? I'd love to try it and use it it that price is ridiculous. Looks like a great app but that makes it a definite no go for me. Maybe a 1 time payment will attract more users for stuff other than a regular car gps,4
"I have been making monthly payments for this service, it has not worked properly, can not plan loads, can not get off line mapping, can not add location to trip",0
"Slow, laggy and taking too much space. Have to pay for truck routes when there's plenty of apps where you can get it for free.",4
Приложение бесплатное но когда загружаеш то вымогает оплату!!!! НЕСОВЕТУЮ,0
I've been trying to cancel the app before the 7 day free trial. I'm not getting any option on canceling this subscription. You have already deducted 30 from my bank account. I need this cancel immediately,4
I downloaded your app one time and never purchased any services. Then deleted it. But you are non stop trying to take money from me. You are thieves. I don't want your service!,0
"App no longer shows truck stops, weigh stations or anything else. it's just a map. That cluttered the screen beyond belief and made it almost impossible to use on a phone because of the little pop-up menu from the bottom that won't go away unless you get rid of everything else on the screen that you need to make the app useful. But don't worry the ads are still showing up",4
App has changed so much can't even just pull up app and see what exit needed for a T/S or parking sad was a good app onc e.,3
Won't find scales,0
I'm not even giving this app one star. I downloaded 2 days ago. And got hammered By robocalls. Over a hundred in an 8 hour period I do not recommend this app download at your own risk.,0
App sucks now since update I know where I am going I just needed to know my options and now locations are not there as soon as you turn it on,0
"I recently tried the 7 day trial. The app is full of glitches and slow to reroute when you miss a turn. Doesn't work in Canada, addresses are minimal. Made for the USA. I didn't cancel before the trial ended and they charged me 200$! I would like a refund! Trucker Path won't refund me the money. Don't bother with this App, buy a physical GPS like Garmin.",0
App was once a good app but now it sucks.... everytime they do a update they mess something up or make it hard to use... need to fix... reviews on places not being updated in app,0
"I'm editing my review. This app used to be amazing, now it won't show any truck stops, parking areas, etc. It asks for a specific stop based on criteria, but is completely unintuitive. Why would you do this? Why would stop showing available parking and truckstops as soon as I open the app? It used to be so simple, but of course the developers have to keep tinkering with it in order to justify employment. They've destroyed something that truck drivers had come to rely on.",2
This app doesn't let me create my profile!!!! Keep telling me that my phone number has been taken.... doesn't let me process the payment or enroll on truckers gps,3
Error happened. Seriously? You can manage to load 4 updates in the popup when you click on a location (when it finally figures out you want the weigh station or truck stop and NOT the parking lot a block away) but then can't load the same 4 updates or the history when you go to the locations page. But you're guaranteed the ads and the spam asking you for parking updates every three seconds will work.,2
"Used it the whole time since I became an OTR driver and loved it! After this last update, however, it is garbage. It is so damned difficult to use now that, after I leave this review, I am definitely uninstalling it. Don't bother with this one. For some reason they 'fixed' something that wasn't even broken.",0
"I am sorry, but this app is a gimmick. I test android apps, and i noticed that this used to be user friendly app, but it became cumbersome. Drivers don't need and can't afford distraction while driving and don't need to be reminded to upgrade premium or gold frequently. Good luck",2
No voice audio turn by turn directions!,0
The new update is so FRUSTRATING!!!! The new menu at the bottom is so completely inconvenient. Gets in the way of double tapping to zoom in and out. Just adds to much stuff to accidentally click on while using the app. Way better BEFORE the update. Very disappointed,1
"It says, that it is a truck GPS, but yet charges monthly for the truck feature...",2
DO NOT USE THE FREE TRIAL BECAUSE YOU WILL BE BILLED 29.99 REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU CANCELL OR NOT. THEN THEIR NO CUSTOMER SERVICE CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL PASS THE BUCK ONTO GOOGLE PLAY WHEN YOU INQUIRE ABOUT A REFUND. HATE THE UPDATED APP!!!!!,0
"I thought this was going to be good because of the features it offers but if you don't pay for either gold or diamond service it's just a car GPS, your better off spending the couple hundred dollars and just buying a Garmin Truckers GPS.",0
"It's got so many pop-ups and ads flying up in your face, this app is now getting aggravating and difficult to use. If you have an app that works is easy-to-use and it's easy to understand why do you have to make it difficult?",2
"This app used to be almost good, but now it totally sucks. The last few times I've used it was useless even after deleting it then reinstalling it. I allow it to track me but it won't find me. It always puts itself near I-80 in Nebraska somewhere when I'm in Tennesse or Kentucky. When I finally find where I am, looking for a rest stop and I find one it tells me I'm over 400 miles away when actually I'm within 50 miles. Just one more thing on the internet thats become more and more unreliable",3
"Well wth happened to this app? I loved this app, and used a long time! Basically just for weight stations and truck stops..but now it doesnt even show me my selected truck stops on the map now! What happened? Do you have to pay for the basic features now?",3
It's not free.,0
APP is giving wrong Mileage.. the last update temp fixed but it will say 21 miles to a place when you are right on top of it etc.. I love that feature I use it constantly & it sucks that its not working correctly!,0
You get the app free but pay monthly a GPS is one time then costs nothing this is a waste of money no ty,0
"I used this app for 2 months and paid for 19 months where is my refund? Oh found out refunds are not allowed for monthly subscriptions. $10.00 a month is about 10 of my driving miles, NOT WORTH IT! To busy working I guess, to keep up with this worthless app. I have canceled the subscription.",0
I wish to cancel the gold membership I have. I tried it and I don't like it. It's not really gold status worthy. I don't know why it won't let me cancel. Even platinum service is not worth what they are asking. I will go buy a Garmin before I would pay for an app that costs more than a phone over 3 years. Total BS.,3
"Looks like a cool app, but don't name it trucker path, make it free, but only for car directions.... if you want navigation that avoids simple things like parkways, you gotta pay 100 bucks a year minimum. Just get rid of the car navigation and make this a pay app. You'd probably get more customers that way. Guess I'll just make do with Google maps or waze and suffer through the constant ""turn around when possible"" until I've driven 10+miles out of the way to get redirected to an expressway...",3
"Tried using the free trial. Without warning, no email or message, they charged my account $164.00 and I can't get in touch with anyone to refund the money. EDIT: I DID contact your support team and they say they ""can't"" refund my money and I am required to go through Google play store. If this is proper refund procedure with your app, why even suggest contacted support? It amuses me that you can easily remove my money from my account, but you can't put it back.",4
Went yhru a non truck route thanks to thus app,4
These guys hit my card for $160. Beware there very deceptive,0
"Not good at all, return the old",0
Keeps shutting down,0
Couldnt try it. It said not enough storage space. Cant delete those useless apps that come with phone.,0
Bad lately,0
"As soon as I paid for $10 subscription it quit working!!! Never could get signed back in, had no tech support! I cancelled. A month later they started charging me over $30 for subscription I am still fighting paypal and google for refund they keep denying. Over $200 stolen from my paypal. For app that quit the moment I subscribe. STAY AWAY. Only works until you subscribe. Canceling don't work they charge triple a couple months later. Keep an eye on them if you cancel.",0
Don't trust these scammers I cancel the 7-Day free trial and they still took $300 out of my account I had to fight with them for 2 months and they still never gave it back I had to process a charge back to my credit card to get the money,4
Been trying to install app for past 3 days and am still waiting. Keeps saying installing.,0
What? Have to get the subscription to update a scale/inspection area status now? 🙄,0
Do not sign up for the free trial! I canceled mine and they still took $300 out of my account. I've called them every day since then and I'm still fighting to get my money back. Update 6/2/2021: still don't have my money back but they have approved the request to submit the request for cancellation and refund. So I guess we'll see if the submitted request is approved. This is ridiculous and this company is a scam.,4
Does this GPS recognize low bridges,0
"How can it show you the way on US 108 to the west in CA when you can't fit with 53 trailer. You can stuck here. And this app keeps freezing. UNSUBSCRIBE!!! (Yes I set up my truck settings 53/8,6/13,6. But in small towns it offers me small sharp turns and roundabouts where big rig can't fit)",3
Not worth it,0
Worse app. Keeps freezing up. Wrong direction. Just not happy at all,3
Have to pay to have any useful features. Useful features actually are not useful at all. There is not anything that can be accomplished with this app that can't be accomplished with a CB. Also when they randomly decide to charge your account early and it has insufficient funds Chey charge you $50 instead of sending you a message like every single other app on earth.,0
"Used app for months, perfect best thing going, then about 2 months ago an updated version. Can't use it, want load, can never find itself, so slow....please put it back or I'm just deleting it because now it's useless! !! Ok, update. Truckers path has gotta back to being what it was before. Helpful, and good app. Still wish it would only show truck routes, why only giving it 3 star.",4
Screen froze up. Wants a bunch of info that I should not have to give. Now I can't find a truck stop. Like you being roped into something.,0
I'm not paying for an app that can not give me a proper eta,0
Installed 5-23-21. Just froze up immediately. Wouldn't let me back out of it or exit. Uninstalled. Using Samsung S9+,0

"I am trying to cancel your Gold subscription. Why I can't find this app in the list of subscriptions? I don't see Trucker Path in the list of subscribed apps in Play Store, however I am still subscribed to Gold. You are still charging me for Gold. Please cancel my Gold subscription",4
Terrible can't even figure out how to cancel it,0
It almost close to junk to use any more between the ads and the stuff they've locked out to get you to pay to use it. They took a good thing and ruined it,0
"This app is very raw for Truck drivers. For one week of use I got THREE wrong location. I reported about one. Then next week again almost the same. When I reported, they want me to describe in detail"" where it's happened, what Hwy I use.. "" and I feel like Its part time job. They have to pay me for wrong address report, but they charge me every month $10.86 instead. I have no time to fix all of that.",0
Why should truck driver have to pay for gps when there is totally free apps for cars,2
You have to pay to get the navigation for big rigs,0
Used the free version for a while now. Decided to pay the subscription and nothing works anymore. Keeps saying error happened or try later. This is what I am paying for?,0
"BEWARE! I tried using their 7day free trial for a one time long distance Uhaul move and it was not helpful at all, so never used.I contacted them a few days later and told them to cancel my subscription and to NOT charge my card, but they did it anyway. I have been fighting with Google and PayPal to get the ridiculous charge of $29.99(!) refunded for the past month. I have sent them numerous emails but no reply until today.. their attempt to rob me again must've failed!",3
"This app got me in a big bind today and I bought the diamond package.. It took me to a spot I couldn't get out of and now I'm out of service and with three tickets. I have no idea why it would've taken me to such a jacked up place. It's ok for the main roads but in town it really sucks and luckily I was able to navigate out of other roads it led me to. If you buy this app, buy it for what it's worth maybe for trip plans or something but ""DO NOT"" trust it to lead you to a truck friendly road",0
This application totally suck I demand a full refund It had me going down streets with NO TRUCKS ALLOWED SIGNS visibly posted!!!!!,0
I tried to cancel the subscription last week but was charged the $30.00 anyways. I do not wanna pay for an app that doesn't work when I need it to. Please refund my bank account the $30.00 just as quickly as you took it out even after I contacted your tech support to resolve the issues. Thanks.,3
I wanted to test drive this app but it wants my credit card info to test it on routes i know. I deleted immediately. 7 day free trial but you want access to my card. No sir,4
Useless in new York city,0
Holy expensive!!!!!!!,0
29$/month,0
Why would I pay $99 gold $299 diamond package when I could buy a truck GPS 1 time and update it when needed yall use to be good now it seems like a scam its called trucker path why is it a cars option???,2
This app is frequently down. Change your route while you are driving. Many distribution centers addresses are not recognized by the app.,0
Horrible. Can even open app to run as it shuts down. Then they charged me for a membership and won't refund. Good luck.,2
"Not user friendly, stops working more than it works",0
not free,0
"Did you realize ""no low bridge"" option is removed from configurations? Did you realize you agree that you might end up in residential areas and no truck routes? Why it's name is ""Trucker"" then? How many times I took the time and reported not truck friendly portions of the route given with screenshots and detailed explanations just to see automated email answers and no changes. Case closed. It's almost time to stop wasting my money..",4
"I bought a eld with these garbagecompany for 2020 volvo and couldn't connect because these trucks connect directly to the fuse in order to work but this stupid people don't know what I'm talking about So they decided to block my number instead of helping me .I paid close to 500,00 for a premium package for 1 year for nothing I just hope that these people were reported to stay out of these business.",2
Tried to use it. It thinks im in iowa... Im in Michigan.,0
"I've been trying to cancel my membership, but it won't let me.",4
Routing is terrible. Tried Routing me off I 40 for 200 miles just to get back on 40. What a joke,0
Just like many other people I pay for this app and it still sends me where trucks should never have been I just don't get it. And I know they gonna tell me to re upload the app. I been up dated this app ... SOME BODY HELP!,3
Wont stay active in the background,0
"You cant unsubscribe, and email gets no respose. Gonna have them blocked on my card. Fkn asshats",0
"Changed my stars to 1 because after recent update I no longer trust this app. I'm an over the road truck driver and available parking is difficult to find at night. Most Walmarts however will let me park there if I promise not to leave trash in the lot. Which I never leave trash anyways. However, tonight I used this app to find a walmart and when I went there,,, no walmart. Same with 4 other spots. I went over my drive hours because of this app and have to park on the on ramp.",2
"I pay for a membership as well. Until this most recent update, it's been great. Now, once you get going, you can't tap on icons to get an updated status, the navigation is sticky and clunky, and occasionally it'll have you going in circles or only offer the longest route possible to get to a destination without alternate route options.",2
Sucks,0
"Coming home from idaho it showed me moving on the map , but when my turn was Coming up it wasn't telling me and it was showing on top of screen I was miles away from it.",0
"Hate this new version, made a big mistake updating it. This app is worthless now.",1
It worked then I installed it on a samsung phone and it failed to put a shortcut on the phone to open it.,0
Have to reinstall it weekly cause of some error or another and it's really getting annoying,0
"Please fix all bugs and lags, just impossible work with it",0
Issues,0
What a joke out here in California Looking for a scale in this thing is trying to send me to illinoise,0
Works well but imagine my surprise when I was being charged twice for two different apps on me phone the basic and the upgrade! I sure as blazes didnt approve that Thats ok cancelled them both. Cant do business with someone I dont trust,0
"Why does this thing try to make me log in all the time? Why do you need my phone number? I get so many spam calls already. I don't need the extra service that comes from logging in. Yes, I see all its features, hmm. Still don't need them even if you say that. How does you having my phone number help me?",2
"Don't follow GPS, input specific tractor trailer info, still navigates through residential neighborhoods that have signs stating no trucks allowed. Especially in long Beach ca where every street has a sign stating no trucks, no commercial vehicles. Good for locating rest areas and what have you but navigation through the town's streets Garbage!!",0
GPS WILL NOT LOAD. GARBAGE,0
This damned app somehow just jumped into my checking account & signed me up for a diamond account without my authorization...trying to find a way to get a refund but the directions I received aren't working!,0
"Hate it! We pay annually for the gold membership and used to love it. Before their update I would scroll ahead on my trip to try to plan out where to stop at but the app won't allow me to do so anymore. It keeps going back to where I currently am. Also the app won't stay zoomed in. It automatically zooms itself back out. I want it to do what I want, not have a mind of its own! I'll be looking for a replacement now.",4
This app glitches way to much seriously its ridiculous,0
Please be aware that gold membership trial date is incorrect it charge my acct early and I could find it any where on Google where my purchase beside that it made me a members without my consent,0
I subscribed about 6 months ago and im still being charged and i can't get ahold of anyone to get reimbursed,0
This app just keeps progressively getting worse. Keeps clearing my route and crashes. If it does give me a route it keeps bringing me back to my current location instead of letting my search the route.,3
Sucks,0
My app keeps crashing and won't open anymore.,3
"Hasn't helped me one bit,yet",0
Keeps crashing,0
GARAGE KEEPS CRASHING 3/22/21,0
The app is crashing a lot lately.,0
Been using this app for almost 2 years since this last update the ap will not open. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app 3 times,1
Since the last update all it does is crash or glitches.,0
App won't open up.,4
After the most recent update The app crashes every time you try to open it,2
App was really good til this new update. Can't even open the app. Needs addressed,2
Send u the wrong way after pick your trip,0
Doez not work,0
"Took me down a no truck route then can't unsubcribe without telling my back to to payment,not trucker friendly just another take your money app",4
Trash,0
"I just updated and noticed that the duplicate icons for nearly every chain truck stop is still there. Of course, this interferes with truck stop updates, and undermines the entire point to this app. Edit: How about you focus a bit less on new garbage and a bit more on function? I'm in Dodge City. When I pull up the app, there's not a single roadway visible.",0
"Purchase the diamond package, the app won't let me run it, wants me to purchase a package again.",4
Can't figure out how to cancel the subscription so can u help,3
This is a pay app. It is not free for truck routing. I uninstalled immediately.,3
It honestly was one of the best I've seen but now they changed everything in it I'm in Canada and it keeps showing me the US it doesn't locate you properly its total garbage,0
Money grab.,0
Downloaded and purchased this for my new tablet and it wouldn't load properly. Very glitchy and slow.,0
Upgraded to use the GPS and it took me down some horrible routes I canceled subscription next day wish I could get my 9.99 back. Do not trust this gps,0
This is a useless App. I regret downloading it. What's the use of it when it can't take you to your destination. I can't be wasting my money anymore.,0
"A total rip off. Tried to cancel before the end of my trial period so I wouldn't be charged, but the app won't allow you to do so. It only allows you to sign up for other subscriptions under the manage your subscription icon.",4
"Every time I go to the app I have waist time and zoom in from 700 miles above my spot , BS that I have to do this when I hadn't had to do it in February",0
Zoom is all messed up after down date,0
"You know a lot of chicken coops use this app to catch you truck driver don't you? If use this app always delete the cache & when use this app always disconnect the gps location until you are finished with the app This app is designed to help pilot, TA etc. To trap you Therefore you should never use GPS when using this app. This app like many apps is designed to so called HELP YOU but you know Any time someone that you don't know is trying to help you even if you didn't ask ? They want to F U",2
"I used to be able to update the scales as I went past them, now I have no idea how to update the scales!!! has this option been taken away from free users? Do you need to pay for the app to be able to update the scales?",3
Over $32 per month to utilize their GPS app! No freaking way am I paying that price. What a joke. UNINSTALLED,0
I put the destination to where I'm going it's only 200-250 miles away and the app is trying to say it's over 1300 miles away,0
"something is getting wrong with the app, for instance, I am at Roswell, NM and need to go to El Paso, TX, when I input directions and press route it takes me somewhere to Kansas",0
Scene you updated site it now only shows trip from New York to where IAM parked at not where IAM going.,0
Bad information,0
"I asked to cancel my subscription, but they continue to charge me. I want my money back.",3
Need internet connection to start trip...why you stated that doesn't need it???????,0
bad app took me through new york streets with 10ft bridges with a 13ft semi don't even try it is garbage,0
This app messes with my phone and all my apps. It freezes up constantly. It's not worth the money.,0
"I am a Gold User for over two years, but strangely, Trucker Path is getting greedy, I got a pop up asking if I wanted a 7 day free trial of the ""Weigh station prediction"" which has been a Gold ""Standard"" item for as long as it is been available. I DONT USE DIAMOND OPTION BECAUSE I DONT NEED THE OPTIONS IT OFFERS, SO STOP MOVING OPTIONS AROUND TRYING TO FORCE US TO GET DIAMOND OR YOU WILL LOSE OUR SUBSCRIPTIONS ALL TOGETHER.",2
"App sucks now... Cannot manually update the weigh stations...it prompts you to fill out multiple choice questionaire and took away the yellow ""actively monitored"" feature. Will not renew annual subscription. My recommendation reverse the update.",0
BEWARE!!! Takes you down non truck routes!!!! Better off using Google maps and looking up truck routes in your area.,4
Been using this app for several years and each year it gets worse and worse. If anyone knows of a RELIABLE app pls let me know,1
It's use to be a good app for truckers but now they are limiting access to some functions if you don't pay them.Im surprised how greedy they are... Re: Your app is glitching as hell!!Thats why I don't use a Pro version.Tell me why are you limited writing any reviews for free version?,3
Get a carriers atlas this app is useless with way to many adds. Also doesn't show all truck stops. There is way to many adds I don't imagine the paid version is any good.,2
Free for cars but have to pay for truck route?? I'll pass😡,4
"Ok so im not one to fully trust a truck gps or any gps for that matter but it works for the most part only problems im having with it is, it will be unresponsive after you leave the app for any reason. If you are using it and playing music it will stop your music. If you are using it while on the phone it will not guide you via voice even though you have it to run through your bluetooth headset. Other than that its fine",2
This app is horrible when you need it for directions... it's led me the wrong way more than twice... it's laggy and glitchy & half of the icons don't show up like weight stations and some others I regret paying for it because it wasn't worth what they're charging,0
Don't really understand why they say 7 days FFFFFFFFRRRREEEEEEEEEEE‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️....then charge you $30😒😒,0
GPS tries to take you through neighborhoods don't come up with addresses horrible,0
It constantly freezes up and I have to close it down and restart it and I pay for that privlage. Dont borther!,0
Horrible they wont even let me unsubscribe,4
New update garbage,1
Useless. I've been looking for an area to specify my truck typical weight and couldn't find it not coming back here,0
"It does not give very accurate directions, and refuses to follow construction cone set up that is not trucker friendly. The app also has a weird habit of randomly closing down in the middle of navigating. The map tends to lag in non-cellular locations and passes. Just called them. The receiver is more dense than a boat on water. Dropped ratings from 3 to 1 star because of this.",0
You took a great app and destroyed it! Change it back!,4
"It's owned, operated, and extemely censored by chinese communist. If you don't like chinese products do not use this pos app.",0
It will not let me on subscribe and keeps taking $10 a month out of my account. There's absolutely no way to cancel this service I even tried sending the company an email.,0
"After new update is joke. Why i have to put some prepared words to change status for Weight Station? I don't want to see any my reviews. I just want to change status Open or Closed that's all. Let me decide when, where and what to riding on reviews tap.",0
I just downloaded it to see if it would give me the truck route to my destination and it was a hard nope.. directing me like I'm a little car lol,4
"I asked for an off line gps program, and when I download this, it requires me to pay for off line maps. I won't even give it 1 star!!!! But of course Google won't let anyone give less than 1 star. So it's 0 stars for this app, and -6 stars for der Herr Google!!!!! Gee Trucker Path answers my review in less than 24 hours and the only thing they do is ask me to download the free trial. Did your algorithm even read my review? I wouldn't recommend this product if you were paying me to use it.",4
I used the paid version of this app for 2 months for 30 dollars i expected 99% accuracy on turn by turn directions n wont let you modify roads bt instead it was more like at 85% it will tell you to do big loops n will take you to no truck roads i end up getting a garming 780 is more accurate n cheaper then this app,4
"I'm an idiot for downloading this app again thinking it would be better. It's even worse than it used to be. Trying to get directions especially, used to be they actually showed you the address for whatever place you're trying to get to, now it just shows the city and zip code. You can eventually get routing through Google maps but it's an easy to miss button. The ""pay us money to navigate to your destination!"" button is impossible to miss though. The devs of this app are nothing but greedy.",1
Good app but i hate couse it's pussing and pressing to buy it... ads are ok,3
Find a different app was great till they updated it,0
why can't i Navigate? i keep pressing my destinations but its not letting me and tomorrow im going to need it what is going on please fix it! my month is up tomorrow if you guys dont fix i will not be paying it,0
Bad directions,0
"New update is horrible, you took away the option to use different maps. Must use yours which cost money. Even though we have ads.",1
"Don't waste your money on the subscription, useless app has a ton of bugs and instead of fixing it they keep adding more features.",0
This app keeps charging me 29.99 to my credit card. I cancelled card and they got new card number and keep charging 29.99 each day. Stay away from this app subscription. Its a scam. Do not pay for this app!! Scam scam,3
Not as easy as I was going for,0
"Downloaded the 7 day free trail which was great!!! After, we decided to pay for it. Now that it is paid for it freezes, has took us down roads we wasnt supposed to be on, dont tell us to turn til last min and so much more! I have checked for updates and i dont know what else to do beside download and pay for a diff app",2
Awful! Wrong info usually and when you want to cancel you cannot! They just keep charging you and no way to stop it!,0
First 2 weeks i was using the PAID version i loved in right into the places I need to be now its constantly rerouting me or completely deleting the route when I'm moving on the highway will not be renewing my subscription just spend the money by a Garmin or rand McNally,0
Terrible experience with the map. If I'm scrolling the map don't assume I'm looking for loads. I don't need pins to drop every 5 seconds and have the phone come to a halt while you look up how many loads are available within 200 miles. If I want to look for loads I know how to find them. Move this to a setting so I can turn it off if I'm just checking the scales or trying to find a truck stop. Let me turn it back on when I want to look for loads. This makes the app almost unusable.,2
"Awesome app ! Don't know how I was without it. So much resources a single thumb touch ! +10 stars love the designated satellite view button on the map and much more ""Google need to take notes"" plz add bigger font options/thicker roads little difficult to see on the tab 8 S2 still love it thanks ! 2-2-21 This app WAS awesome. But i hate everything thats on a monthly subscription 😕. Willing to pay one time fee but not a monthly 9.99. Blood sucking leaches!!!",3
Is not all the weight station on the map with new update,1
"Can't navigate every time I need to call, when I called they were not available to talk and don't have any other options to help",0
Guess they don't want to make any money. I joined everything was a go then out of nowhere they kept asking me for my email address and the password to it. WHAT??? Why do you want access to someone email account? They don't give you a skip option either. The app won't work until you do it. I won't so I will be canceling this purchase. Are drivers really giving these people their password to their email account???,4
They suck,0
Doesn't let you create your own trip keeps trying to route me to 80 even though I'm in kingman az 80 is hundreds of miles north and we're going to Iowa,0
They want ransom money 💰 Complete trash you cant use them because they get want money.. Nothing like what it was once🤨🖕🖕👌,0
Dont bother with this app. They constantly call you even if you buy the service. Then talk you into a deal that is definately not worth it. Once you find out they barely have any loads they refuse to refund. There are alot better apps out there for loads and ELD service. Most brokers have thier own boards now. I requested a refund and they gave me the run around and still haven't in over a month refunded or agreed to a refund. I have sent several emails regarding this. SEVERAL as in >10,0
"Complicated , expensive",0
R.i p Trucker path... Whoever's idea it was to update this app should be fired. No reason to remove active monitoring status away and take away the ability to manually leave a review or update status. The app is no longer flexibile.,3
Didn't have voice directions despite setting up correctly,0
Downloading the app is slow and has problems,0
"Absolutely disgusting how greedy they are. They are deliberately making it harder to use this app, night vision on during day time and day vision on night time and you have to pay to change that. Extremely unsafe when you're driving. I've been using this app for many years but I'm searching for a different option now because this is just unacceptable.",1
Trying to update...just keeps recalculating. I use this app every day...very disappointed. Was going to purchase...now not too sure. Please fix it!,2
The idiot who did the last update probably never drove the truck. Why fix something that works good?,0
Makes you pay to unlock the truck GPS.,2
You really need to add just a little more garbage to the screen on this app when this app came out it was nice it was simple and worked well. now it is full of ads and clutter a lot of very distracting items on the screen!!!!,0
Horrible update! How in the hell do I write a comment at a weigh station? Where is the button?? Why make so complicated??,2
"Absolute Dog S**t. Gps would say straight as I'm passing my exit, then it said turn right. Tried to take me through ditches to truck stops. Maps kept glitching and resetting my trip. DO NOT USE, and I paid for the gold.",2
It sucks,0
If you shut down for the night you have to download everything again for Rowdy this app sucks,0
Cant ever pick up my location!!,0
Cannot get help from support... Your answering machine says that its not convenient for you to answer the phone... That sums up my experience... as long s its convenient for you... doesn't really matter about me...,0
"You really screwed up this app with these latest updates. You used to be able to see parking availability from the map, now you have to click each individual spot. With the most recent jan update you can no longer toggle places if you search for a location and have to close and reopen the app.",0
Trash will not load up route waste of money,0
"I've really gotten good use from the app, but after the latest update it seems that ALL Love's have been removed... Really!?",3
Absolutely horrible with all the bloat that has been added making the app impossible to run. Had to install a version from over two years ago just to be able to use smoothly.,0
🚮🚮🚮,0
Just another bloat product for phone. This gave me car directions and road where trucks were prohibited. Just use Google.,1
Useless app.,0
How do you contact their support?,0
"Only feels.limenits helpful for the long haul with weight stations and parking. The GPS portion is horrendous. Took me 1 way, only to tell me 20 minutes later that I needed to head to exact opposite direction. Waze does much better and its free.",0
"This app almost got me in an accident, I had the specs perfect and it still led me up a road that I wasn't supposed to be on and tried to make me do an illegal u turn that I wasnt able to make. Do not download",0
Truck option was not available without paying,0
"I tried advertising through tracker path, there platform was failing and didn't work the way it supposed, they kept saying that they will send this case to tech support but nothing changed, they charged me for 2 months $800 for nothing, worst platform for advertising, i cancel my account with them after 2 months and moved to a better platforms.",0
After New update it's just worse than before,1
Since latest update I can't just look at the map and see what scale is open/closed. Scale tab was removed and everything jumbled together. Was close to buying a subscription. Glad I didn't. This good app became garbage. I downloaded Jack Reports. For an app that doesn't offer much currently surpasses trucker path on the weigh station side.,3
BOUGHT BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY DO NOT USE,0
The older version was much better. Now the app just shows all the weigh stations as green. Used to be green for open and red for closed. Now you have to click on every weigh station to know the status. Pretty much worthless now. Give me back my older version.,2
"At first I have to say...it's best app ever I used before. But the last update crashed app so bad. ""Places"" have been changed and complicated to search necessary information about truck stops , price and weight station. I can add pictures of old version and new. And developer can compare it and release why truck drivers prefer for old style app.",3
Not all locations are updated and it should be free for any class a drivers,0
Takes you out of route two places trucks can't go try to unsubscribe will not let me,0
Did not route correctly in New York areas,0
I unsubscribed last month and truckerpath keeps charging my card I'm sick of seeing charges on my card for a service I dont use,0
Not helpful,0
"Poor directions. Took me on non truck route, residential areas. Too many voice commands by an irritating female voice that I just wanted to slap. Not interested in the product enough to keep it.",4
"I used to love this app. Since the latest update, I don't like it at all. How can I uninstall the last update?",4
"Latest update sucks. I used to be able to get directions using other apps, use my smartlink app, then send a link to my Garmin GPS. They did away with that feature, now it's only chrome or Google maps",3
Horrible app always freezes,0
I Unsubscribed And you're charging me anyways You are Criminals,0
"Was there a major update recently? Truck GPS is not working reliable as before, it gives wrong or different routes compared to Rand McNally & Garmin. I use Trucker Path GPS for one reason! Search for truck stops on my route but since the routes are wrong no point of using it.",2
"Ever since the new update, it only gives me 2 options for navigation, maps or chrome, that's it. Before the update I could send coordinates to my Garmin, from trucker path, Which always came in handy, cause alot of times I'm always searching for the cheapest fuel and the garmin don't really give the mom & pop places like trucker path, so all I would do is click on the direction button and it would give me the option to either use maps or the Garmin smartphone link, plz fix it n bring tht back,",4
The new UI sucks.,0
The closely monitored feature was very helpful and i don't know why it has been taken off it would be nice if it can be brought back,2
Make sure you need it for ever.Because you cant cancel it.or at least I been trying for weeks!!!!!!,0
"False advertisement, you have to pay to get the truck routes , im deleting this immediately!",4
"Update 18 Dec 20: App used to be the best, now it's just junk. Even the paid yearly subscription has ads all over it. These devs got greedy. I love this app. I use it all the time. Wish all drivers had this. 5 stars.",4
Disappointed. The app use to be free as far as navigation even if the route was a little off. Not feeling the change where now everything is via monthy charge now. Not good.😞,1
Stopped giving me an option to navigate via Google maps. Opens uber.. last week it would give me an option to choose between uber and Google maps. Now it opens automatically through uber everytime. Tried on my wife phone same thing,1
This new update really sucks before you were able to add notes what's going on on the road and stuff like that now you can't you guys need to put that features back on because there's a lot of dot officers that stop and trucks nowhere next to the scale houses thank you,1
"I have been trying to cancel this subscription and can not get it to cancel. What do I need to do to cancel? I have tried to go to play store and to the subscription,and its not there to unsubscribe. And I have tried to call Google, and all you get is a recording. Says they are not taking calls do to the covid virus.",3
$300 per year for diamond truck routing? Are you kidding me??? I can buy a truckers Garmin with lifetime maps for less than that!!!,0
Worked fine four years ago. Two years ago an update broke it and the app would crash every time I tried to pull up the details of any truck stop. But it was still useable as long as I just used the map. Just updated it again and now it crashes every time I open it. Completely unuseable.,0
I'm not paying for directions just to be safe. This app is making money over being ethical to human life,0
Slow doesn't do anything I asked it to do,0
Was great until they overloaded it with addsand got greedy. Luckily a driver recommended the Road Hunter app. I suggest everybody try it. And what the hell is uber doing on the direction function...smh,0
Idk how but these idiots keep making the app worse american need buy this darn thing back chinese devs can't do anything right. It keeps constantly crashing lately,0
I subscribed to be a gold member from jump. Was 3k over scale on drives and had a Stateline coop to breeze through to be good as can be. (Already popped an overweight ticket 400 miles back with same load) the app finally indicates the hawks are sleeping so I roll........ big green open sign 2 miles onto 44w............. F U C..................... unsubscribed and deleting after I finish this thing. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY DRIVERS!!!!!,0
When i go to navigation it wont let me use google maps anymore. It just opens my uber app.,1
"What happened? This app used to be user friendly. I don't understand how some developers think they need to ""improve"" something that's working perfectly great. Suxz now. Thanks.",3
I have used this app for over 5 years I use to love it before they got greedy like everyone else and removed a large portion of the mom and pop truck stops from the free version. I've never trusted the driver reviews or parking availability. With that said I say boycott this app and delete it most of the truckers I know have already done this and after I leave this review ill be deleting it also.,1
"there service is not working but they still charge, no refund, horrible customer service, i am done with truckerpath",0
"This app is garbage wall looking at the general map you cannot find the fricking scale or truck stop in your route if you type scale image search it gives you 1,000 miles away why would I want to be looking for a scale thousand miles away from me to balance my love and make it. Illegal Cypress garbage",0
"Last year app start going down on usability. Glitchy, overcrowded with icons, menus and ads. Last update bring Uber to show you a route to truck stop when you used Google maps before. A year ago I used this app 90% of my driving and now I using it so rarely like 5% of all my driving time.Looks like new owners of the app trying to make a game from this app and not useful tool for truckers. It was so simple and brilliant to use it before... So upsetting!",0
"It was a good app, when it was simple. Now, by adding in all the rest of your carp, it's become garbage.",3
GPS does work. Can't cancel membership.,0
Was great until an update. Whenever I hit directions it defaults to Uber. It doesn't give me options anymore,0
"This app was good, now it's completely useless - Uninstalled",0
After using this app it's still trash never accurate every time you create the trip you get out and go back you have to start over super slow too many stupid ads it was great when it was owned by Americans now it's owned by China half of these weight stations inaccurate fuel prices inaccurate and the most annoying of all is the weigh station monitoring garbage does not tell you if it's open or closed remove that trash and fix the app,4
"Very slow to load, switching screens IE closing use our route progam 7 days free, takes forever. When the road map comes up, it takes 7 min to load anything. Only thing it was good for is fineing a truck stop that has some parking, however, I think a lot of people stopped using the app, because every truck stop is 14 hrs to several days behind.",0
Its allways lossing the gps,0
Yo i never seen such stupidity in my life from folks. How is you a truck app but you have to pay to use the trucking services? The creators need to rethink their life choices,0
If only I could upload screenshots of the routes this this tried taking me.,0
"Was always free its why people use to use it now very unpopular and times are hard you want charge you know what you can do with your app, let me not even!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Won't stop charging you after you cancel the service,0
Can get it to load,0
How are you going to charge a fee for using trucking directions when this is a TRUCKING APP!?!?! That makes absolutely zero sense... until trucking directions are free for us truckers to use it will stay at a 1 star... I would give it a -5 star if I could but 1 star is the lowest rating i can give which is still too many stars,0
You can't contact suport or leave a comment/review with out signing in. I will not give you my email!!! This app was great 3 years ago but now not worth using for free let alone paying for it,0
Horrible. Navigation was more lost than I was.,0
"There was a time when this app was gold. But, a couple years and several greedy programmers later, it's clogged with garbage ads and pleas for money. I'd considered spending a few bucks to get it, & get it WITHOUT ads, but not for the $$ they are wanting. We gotta deal with crooked load-brokers, pay-to-park truck stops and greedy repair shops. Damn, if it wouldn't be nice to get a good deal for something.....",2
"29.00 a month for an app that's supposed to navigate you through truck friendly areas.. if you don't buy it, they route you with a car in mind... don't get this product. They're scum.",0
"They are stilen my money , the subscriben me without i autorization",0
Why would i pay fot it the demo is unusable. The experience of testing this app is so add ridden that no reason to ever think the final product is worth anything. Total disregaurd to the trucking community. Over bloated junk,0
Used to be free which was great because it was all truckers input I've been with the app since they were started I launched it today just to check something and I see they've gone to the pay scheme they've taken all of our data and now they're charging us for the most basic use of the app uninstalling and will not be paying to essentially use our own data.,2
Lags and freezes too much. Not reliable,0
"New update makes the app nearly unusable. Horrible color scheme with a black map, blue roads and gray borders make it impossible to see anything on the map. ; Customer support is non existant if you don't pay for their monthly membership which offers no benefits other than things that should be free or are free in other apps. ; Ads everywhere. Pop-ups even. In 2020 who even stoops so low to pop-up ads? Businesses can pay to show even if you have that brand/service marked as hidden",1
Had me LOST. There was no voice guided. Copilot way better. I don't care for the features on Truckers path.,0
"Constantly freezes and throws away.When the route has already been built, you try to click on truck stop or rest area or weight station to find out the details, but there is no response from the application. When the application builds a route, its distance never coincides with either garmin or google maps, always several tens of miles more.Developers please fix these bugs",1
"This app deserves zero stars!!!! The very first and last time I used this God forsaken app, it sends me onto 3 roads that trucks aren't allowed on!!!!!!!! They actually have the nerve to charge people for this worthless app!!!! How dare they want $300 a year for the subscription. The creator of the app should have to pay all tickets any truck driver receives for using the app!!! Pure trash app never use this under any circumstances!!! It's better to get lost and never be found than to use this!",1
Not good 👎👎👎...BS..,0
"First downloaded app, all was great, installed on new device and now I have to pay for truck routes but 4 wheelers are free?!?! I thought this was a truckers app???? Bad move!!!",4
Gps will take you down roads not made for truck s. You'll be lucky if it doesn't cost you your job. I can't say anough bad things about this app and the GPS It will send you 2 exits down just a turn around on the frontage road and go back to exit to where you wanted to go and send you down the wrong direction from a truck stop just to turn you around at the next exit to head the other way,0
"I moved the first review down, now I'm posting another period to the systems manager. When I make a post, for the benefit of all drivers, and you remove it. I consider this app part of commonism. Now you're going to deal with the federal government, my federal lawyer will be involved App security is very low, not very hard for a hacker to get in and change your postings, even possible to see your profile so watch your credit card number.",0
It was good in the beginning but now it's a piss off crapp sorry but all the updates just made it bad,0
"Why is truckers path asking it's users for suggestions on how to correct bugs and problems with their own app? That's like asking a shopper how to stock shelves. If you want end users to use your product, it's your job to remain competitive to keep them. It's not an end users job to keep you competitive nor should they offer such advice without proper compensation.",0
Does not let you change your route while doing the route,0
"Very cluttered interface, and can't set truck maximum speed for calculating the eta",0
Too expensive and nothing is free to try,0
"Notifications are annoying. The app just sent a notification in the middle of my 10 hour break, at 5am while I'm sleeping, to remind me it's election day. I just uninstalled. Don't get the app if you don't want your sleep ruined. We're drivers, and we need our sleep. Whomever thought the notifications were a good idea, ruined the app. Will never use another trucking app, they're all pretty worthless anyway. Going to be cranky today, because this app cost me over an hour of sleep. Worthless!",3
The thing has a lot of glitches I keep trying to call them to discontinue my service but nobody is available what the hell do I have to do to stop them from taking my money for nothing,0
Sucks not worth the money,0
Thought this was for Truckers!! Loaded it and found out have to pay for the truck route options!! Uninstall!!!!,4
The update is no good i want it back to the way it was ..,0
The navigation is difficult to use. I still use Google,1
Not free.,0
I was driving my 18 wheeler and it tried to get me onto a road with a 5 ton weight limit and then it took about 30 seconds while driving 30 to 40 miles per hour for it to recalculate. This app is less useful than even Google Maps. From what I have seen it is really not a trucker GPS app. I used it for a couple hours and got so frustrated with it that I uninstalled it the same day. It kept trying to put me on roads that are not meant for trucks.,3
All I want is weight station info,0
"Extremely displeased with the app since the recent update. I pay a monthly fee to have this for navigation, parking, etc. Will be discontinuing my membership and go back to my GPS.",2
"Pay for truck paths or its s free car path lol Yeah people need to make money but if your app is a free class c vehicle app with an optional trucker mode, may be don't call it Trucker Path.",4
this was such a great app wheb i first got it but now it is ABSOLUTELY RIDDLED WITH BUGS! Prettymuch can't use it anymore !!!,4
I can no longer update the status of weigh stations and truck stops. Customer service said upgrading my subscription to gold would fix it. It did not unfortunately. Theres also too many ads and the app just doesn't work a lot. It used to be a good app but its horrible now.,3
A free truck app that you have to pay for to use the truck navigation...makes sense🙄,0
CAN'T GET TRUCKERS PATH ON MY ANDROID PHONE,0
Lay off the ads. I've seen predatory mobile games that harass me multitudes less than this app does.,0
It say free but its not free,0
Not dependable works one minute and stops working the next I un installed this app. All they want is $$$$$$$,0
I don't know what they did to this app but it is now trash it's no good at all unless you pay for it. Trash I am deleting it,2
"Pay for one membership, then they move features to a new membership in which you have to pay three times as much for the exact same thing.",0
Hate the new update ..everytime you do an update it just creates more options to have to press to get where i want in the app..it used to be simple easy and quick..big thumbs down for user experience at the moment,1
"**☆☆☆Ripp off alert!!☆☆☆** Thought try them out again was told. They inproved. Had. 7 day trail period, was not inpressed. Tried canceling for 3 days. Then then charged me early. And only then could i cancel. Worhless app. Will share my exp with every driver i meet and every new driver i train to make sure they dont get ripped off. Update. Never heard back from there customer service. Just this polite response about my review. So far. 8 other drivers have tha ked me for the warning.",0
Terrible customer support. I emailed them to let them know that I did not wish to continue past my trial period and they still charged me. Told me to take it up with Google Play. Very poor customer service.,0
Trucker Path Cancel my subscription because you're Professional Thieves! You have not reimbursed me and taking more money again. You are thieves!,3
You guys ruined this app,0
Doesn't not apply the 2 or 3 hour 14 hour pausing of the clock. Still stuck on the old HOS,0
I keep trying to cancel my account but no one helps! Even sent them a copy of the withdrawal and they still say I don't have an account with them.,0
"Wow I don't know where to start. There is no way in hell real truckers had anything to do with the development of this app. I use this app next to my Garmin for better reference while diving. This app was trying to have me go down 1 way streets the wrong way, it want me to go down streets where trucks never should go down, if you want to get jammed up and put in a really bad spots then this app is for you. You can't check inspection and weigh stations while using the navigation part of the app.",2
This app is a joke. Used it for years now u have to pay to get anything decient out of it including simple things like parking avalibility.. Im deleting it. I do not recomend downloading it. Smh,0
Never works. Keeps closing app. Or freezing.,0
App is a piece of S**t been paying for it for two months now and it hardly ever works. Glitches all the time. Waste of money DON'T PAY FOR THIS TERRIBLE SERVICE.,0
It's a rip off . Not worth it. Keeps on freezing and slow.,0
"This app used to be really good. But, now the developers have gotten greedy. It's full of annoying ads. And, you can't just buy the app to get rid of them. They want a monthly subscription. Also the interface has gotten progressively more and more cluttered over the years. It's gotten to the point that I can't do anything without first getting rid of all the popup menus that I don't want or need. I just want to see what's on the map. If I want more information, I'll click on something.",0
"Is this app taking pictures of us? I've heard the picture shutter sound twice today, followed by some accept/cancel notification?",0
"Used to be a good app, now its getting worse with every update",3
Wont download for me,0
"Don't use this app, you have to be careful, app will take you on non truck routes and down restricted roads.",4
"Yes, I am asked on this app. to pay for the truck navigation gps features (gold or diamond). Talk with other truckers they said they use this app and they are not paying for this truck navigation gps features. Are some truckers asked to pay while others are not to use this app.",2
Its not a free app like advertised.. b.s.,0
"It will crush your phone! App is overloaded as is even if you turn off all stops , and of course they loading with lots of adds, my phone hates it. Verizon, samsung phone. You will get info you need, but prepare to wait and you how it goes 🍻🍻🍻",0
"The map is so cluttered with fuel stop, convenience stores, truck stops, which I dont need.",2
Everytime you drive by a rest stop or truck stop a window pops up wanting you to tell them how the parking was. I'm not trying to look through trees or off the road for that matter to tell you if you can park there. The verbal ques are horrible as well.,0
I've been trying to unsubscribe to this app for 3 months! They just keep taking money out of my account. It looks like it's no way of unsubscribing to this app. I'm very unhappy,0
Great app for quick planning ! 9.4.20 The free app was better than the version I pay $100 year for. Trip planning is a pain in the ass along with finding fuel stops.,4
"This app --- something happened -- IT SUCKS! it takes forever to come up, they want you to buy something -- or something I don't know, BUT IT REALLY SUCKS. Originally I gave it 5 STARS. My old review: ""This app makes my getting around much easier. I use it for trip planning mainly. I wish more drivers would participate to help keep parking space count, & scale openings up to date."" I UNINSTALLED IT!",2
"Use to have lots of features to use for free now you get charged for damn near everything on there, the app also freezes and shuts down alot.",0
"The App is ok, but why the hell are people from trucker path calling me and texting me trying to sell me ELDs???????",4
Should say pay for app upfront,3
This is not free,0
Trucker Path SUCKS IF I COULD GIVE IT O STARS I WOULD,4
Useless,0
navigation aint workn,0
"So...after getting paid by forcing us to watch ads...now this company wants us to pay for updates not provided by the company, but its users....patiently waiting for some other app to supplant this.",0
"Just tried opening the app. See the TRUCKERPATH logo, then get a black screen. No response from the app after that.",0
Sucks,0
Doesn't work,0
"please make the app for Apple in the section weight stations-calendar as informative as in Android, the history for 7 days in Android is not in Apple. Please fix it.",0
Paid for it now its charging 30 a month and I can't cancel it for some reason,0
"Very useful app but the interface could use a lot of help. Sometimes the app freezes up due to an advertisement. Also this app sometimes hijacks Google Maps when you open the app, exiting navigation in Google Maps which is a very annoying bug and therefore gets 1 *.",1
Hard to use. Not practical,0
"This app works when it wants. Steadily trying to take me down dirt roads or even better showing me an unrestricted truck route and still tries to route that way. More times than none it puts me in residential areas because the place where I'm going is on the other side a fence. Its always rerouting me, telling me to turn left or right when I'm clearly on the interstate. The best one is when it waits until the last second to tell me my turn is coming up.",4
"I used to love this app. After I updated it, I hate it!!",4
This app has gotten worse...use to be very easy to use and simply now they charging for everything and the app complicated to navigate through,0
"I used to be able to use the app and count on it, now since you have to pay for it. It doesn't work anymore like yall are trying to get rich fast off of an app that doesn't work anymore. Its just sad how greedy this is. I will try to find another app. Thanks",0
"The app allows ads,which also allow adult web cam ads to come across top of screen in maps,rather disturbing while trying to do your job,not to mention the sex trafficking that runs rampid in our society.",0
One star not because it's a bad app but due to other drivers not updating stops!!!! IF YOUR NOT GOING TO UPDATE AND HELP OTHERS DON'T DOWNLOAD THE APP!!!!!,0
Starting to piss me off it doesnt work everytime i try to use this it says no route could be found,0
"When the app was free it worked perfectly all over the country even with the weakest service. Now it's a paid app and so full of ads but doesnt work in the mid west at all and sometimes in the rest of the country. How many of you drive a new car since you started charging for ""premium""? Should have optimized your app first. Its almost unusable anymore.",2
"On your trip it now says 935hrs and 52 minutes to go 1081 miles. Wow , last upgrade 2 days ago did this. Ridiculous!!!!!",0
"App doesn't route, says no connection. They want $29.99 for a Google maps app, that doesn't even work at all in the free version lol. Who would pay this ridiculous price for a map that is exactly like Google maps. Only difference is the truck stops you can just push a button instead of just typing in Google maps ""truck stop"" $29.99 craziness, and ridiculous! Lots of features that no one will ever use. Just want to see where the truck stops are, and how full they are. Worth 1 time pay $2.99 not",1
"Last updated 08\03\2020 sucks, they charge you for Just looking at the icon on your home screen. You're better off googling truck stop near insert location. 🤬",0
This app is sucking data. This month 14g this app alone. I only use it a few times a day when I'm on the road. It didn't do this last month. I'm not doing anything differently with it. But my phone says it's this app doing it. Something wrong there.,1
Took me right down a street In chicgao clearly marked with low bridges! Google maps took me the right way but i went with this trash cause it was designed to help you avoid those streets. Was a absolute nightmare getting out of that mess!,1
Blocks all reviews even if there is no swearing and none of their guidelines are broken,0
"Used to be a usable app, garbage 🗑️ now.",0
Definitely cannot not trust this for truck trailer navigation if u hav no experience cuz it will take u to a dirt road an probably end up calling for a towing company to get u out like I did lol,0
How are you calling it a truckers app but giving directions for cars?!,0
Too many adds too expensive too much junk i cant justify using. Too bad used to be great. Just uninstalled. I reloaded and used a few times. But recently looked at it and checking status of scales or truck stops wouldnt work always an error. Noticed it was using over 1.5 g data to keep on phone. Not worth it even as an occasional user so deleted it again.,3
They want you to pay for everything tried to route from ky to sc and it wants to add 90 miles and run you into va verses through the gorge. NOT WORTH IT. IT BLOWS DONKEY DICKS,0
App is no longer useful for scale status.,0
This app was good 👍 now is garbage 💩💩💩💩,0
"This app used to be the best. Now it blows dog dick. Try and route through Wyoming? It will absolutely take you everywhere but. You in Colorado Springs? It says you are in Kansas city. Simple trip plan interface? Hell no! You need to add a stop on the fly? Kick rocks. You need a refund or technician help? You get snotty, rude and utterly useless humans on the line. Charge you 30 bucks can't afford to make it work. Your Qualcomm is better then this app",3
The new update suck!,1
"it took to low clearances knowing im 13'6"" put me bad spots and didnt take to the addresses i needed twice put me in the middle of nowhere sad i liked this app til as of late canceling my subscription",0
Doesn't work. Error on parking status and no reviews. Nxt day and it works wth,0
"I had trouble earlier. It wouldn't load if scales are open or closed or how populated truck stops where. They replied telling me that they fixed it and to download the newest update. But guess what, there is no new update. This app used to work just fine but is becoming garbage very quickly.",3
"This used to be a great app until RTS bought it. Now it's just a shitstain on the trucking industry. You used to be able to get advance notice of what the scales are doing. Now you only get a green or red W to show the location of the scale. You also used to be able to leave a review, but now you need an account so they can get all of your personal information. What a JOKE!",4
Trucker path used to be good. But iver the past few days it may or naynot work depending on its mood. Now today. Nothing works. Nothing but errors and can't login in try sgain later and cant manage my paid membership. Can't do anything!!,3
"Would have given it 3 stars until today... Now all I can get is ""error happened"" turned into a pos",0
Error on everything. Nothing works! Guess I'll cancel my subscription since this seems to have been happening for a number of days with no answers from the creator. Why pay for something that's useless? Waste of hard earned money!,3
So concerned with adding ads and pay tiers you ruined your own app constantly crashing,0
Crappy app used to tell you when the weigh stations were open now all it does is says error,4
"Used to work... but lately it will not let me route my driver thru the way they want. Whatever you did to it made it unusable to all but those forced to pay for so called ""premium services""; the same services that used to be free. Capitalism at it finest, making money off of hard-working, blue collar, essential workers. I will be dumping this app after this comment. Shameful!",0
Don't waste your time,1
APP HAS STOPPED WORKING TODAY! CANNOT EVEN LOG INTO ACCOUNT,0
"I was a good app a few years ago, now if has nothing but ads on top of ads. When an ad isn't coming up it's still using a ton of data and none of the information on the truck stop will load.",1
Every time I need the app the most is when it don't want to work and doesn't show me the parking status.,3
Maps is not working since the update will not find any off the Addresses I put in will not even try to,0
This App Sucks as of Today!!,0
Too expensive for so little,0
This used to be good. It has become unusable of late. The truck stop reviews and comments are censored. I actually bought a paid subscription version but the paid full featured version went away as soon as the app was updated. Speaking of updates. They are constantly updating the program. Every update makes the program less usable. There has to be a better solution,3
It crashes constantly...horrible,0
It takes me to roads that big rigs should never be on and it's always a round about route,0
This app has become super buggy to the point of useless! It is forever telling me it cannot route because of no internet connection when I most certainly have internet.,0
Dissatisfied!!!,0
Horrible. Used to be great.,3
"it will ask you to give them all of your money every minute, BIG SCAM",0
"Pretty sad that a tool like this app is being used for hook ups and prostitution. The forum will be the reason for the apps demise. Just like the CB, people abuse it and those that know how to act right stop using it to avoid the nasty trash thinking with their crotch not their brain.",3
"Up to today, the app worked fine. Today, every time that I typed in an address, the app says ""No Results Found "". I uninstalled it, reinstalled it and it still says ""No Results Found"". I will be canceling my subscription to the app until the app is fixed.",0
"The best app before 2 years. Now is only money want app. They Hide half of every truck stop! This is racism to truck drivers!!! After every update is going bad and more bad! Free trucker app, haha you must hide this picture!",1
This app sucks.,0
"#SMH Not worth $30 a month but very useful app, I started using this years ago and it has always been a really good resource i can't put enough on that, but as far as navigation gose its horrible, it constantly stops, it wants me to do u turns in the middle of my trip or if you add stops for your break it won't continue, they need to go back to the drawing board with this..... i think everyone with a cdl should have this app and i wish the navigation worked but till then its 2 stars for me",0
Map lead you off truck routes,4
Unfortunately doesn't work,0
"I used to be happy with this app, but recently it has been bombarded with ads. Sure they will go away if you pay for premium. To me it has outlived its usefulness. I can download truckstop aps and Google map rest areas all with out commercials. Was great before all the ads started.",0
"Used it for finding scales, truck stops, and walmarts. Deleting due to their customer service constantly harassing me about buying the subscription. I have told the same guy multiple times i am NOT paying to look for truck stops. He keeps calling me weekly. Too bad, i liked the app. Have fun, truckers path. Looks like youre going to be on the downfall.",2
"wont stay up keeps error blacks out, i have to Uninstall and reinstall app everyday to get it to work this is totally ridiculous",0
"Get rid of the forums. ASAP!!! Was a great app, now it's been putting ads in it. About to Delete it al together.",4
Tolls prices are incorrect,0
Been using this app for 3yrs now for free and slowly you started eliminating info. and want to charge a ridiculous fee per month!! HEY DRIVERS DONT PURCHASE THIS APP GO PURCHASE A RAND AND SAVE YOUR #$,1
Was good. Now try using this with ads while driving? It's like they want to kill us or make themselves unusable. I can't pull over every 30 second to clear the ad windows.,0
"Got roped into a subscription. Said it would be easy to cancel. Made four payments with no benefits. Would love to cancel, apparently not possible. Stay away...",0
Don't use it as truck navigation. It will send you through no truck zone. It happened with me. Some of good truck stops not shown on map anymore. I've canceled my subscription. This app is eating too much power and data. Showing wrong diesel prices most of the time. It was very good app. Not anymore. Very overpriced right now,3
Need to update parking..half the businesses or places listed for parking DO NOT ALLOW parking or have no parking at all. Also app use to be free and now it cost...if Google maps were trucker friendly I would be using them..at least they are free....,1
I can't get any navigation or routing to work over the past couple days. Very disappointing considering I have to pay for this. Fix soon or I'll be canceling my subscription.,0
You'll run out of fuel waiting for this app to load. Deleting it,0
"They used to have a useful app here. Unfortunately, I contributed to this community for years by leaving updates and reviews. Now this is a pay app. The free version has so many ads and so many features restricted it is fairly useless. The pay version claims to offer truck navigation; however, it performs terribly. Suggests ridiculous routes and then freezes during use.",3
"When i first downloaded this years ago, it was wondwrful for us truckers and i literally told every trucker i know to download it. However, NOW they are charging truck drivers for this app, and instead are allowing cars to use this for free. I will no longer be telling truck drivers about this app, and instead will tell my trucker buddies to delete it. I am deleting it as well. I do NOT reccomend this to any truckers.",0
"Your typical corporate app. Started as free 4 years ago and now they want to charge for navigation. Really? I'm old school. I want to see the benefit of paying for something. Especially when it started free. At $10 a month, I can actually buy a truck GPS with much better features than this app. I guess I'll be deleting the app.",2
"When I decided the app did not work for me the way I figured it would and decided to unsubscribe, it would not cancel my monthly premium. Still paying for something I do not want. Buyer beware on paying for a subscription.",0
"Worked great till last update. Now it doesn't want to do optimized truck routing, only car. I've chosen this over a GPS. Might be time to change that. Good bye gold subscription. Update called and spoke to a rep that stated it had to be bumped up to the next level. I'll receive a call back in 24 hours. Well it's been 5 days. No call yet. Great customer service 5 stars...",0
Four years ago I gave the app a single star because the developer required a rating before you could even open the app. Today I'm not changing the one star rating because this isn't a trucker friendly app. 10 out of every 11 truck stops aren't truck stops. Those stops can't even accommodate a single truck on their lots. I guess developer thinks he's fooling us when all he's doing is infuriating us. I had stopped using the app shortly after installing and that's the new game plan.,2
I'm subscriber to this app but it's stupid app you put truck route and it will ask you to take U turns in a very tight place where you barley take a U turn with a car. And also won't show you which direction you have to go just 1-40 won't tell you west or south so get ready for alot of wrong exits if you driving a semi truck. And it crashes all the time all the time yes. simple word's is stupid navigation for trucks. This app only good for checking rest area and gas station parking spots.,4
"Piss poor, advertise, takeaway features, then want to charge",0
Useless nothing but ads trying to sell stuff,0
Today is Monday June 1st app is dead Frozen on places shows nothing,0
I want to cancel my subscription and stop the monthly charge.,3
Some looses GPS signal app not worth paying not able to edit routes,0
This app is totally f'd up and disgusting. How in the hell are you going to allow anyone to post pornography on this app? There's homosexual pornography posted all over this app. This isn't what this app should be about and it serves no real purpose to improve the quality of life on the road for Truckers.,0
"Been trying to cancel this membership for a year and with no real assistance. I have been sent instructions on how to do this but when I get to the last step where the unsubscribe button is to be, there is no such button. Customer service has been rude and they claim I have no account with them but they are taking money out but how is that possible?",0
Damn wts up with all the ads this sucks,0
App is malfunctioning and doesn't see an internet connection when there is an internet connection,0
I doesn't work... It used too but not no more... It doesn't even let me download it....,0
"Moderators should stop censoring reviews. If you're a truck driver, you've got bigger fish to fry than losing sleep because you read a dirty word. Another censored comment on your app just cost you another star, douchebags!",2
Lots of ads UI is not user friendly,0
"i can not believe, I payed money for this constantly appearing ""no internet connection"" message! Guys, my work depends on reliable navigation!",0
"Now the ""add review"" isn't even an option....",0
"Dropping to 1 star. Downgraded app version to where it was smooth and simple 1. Who really use their navigation? 2. Do you really need their predictability of parking? Most of you can predict parking month ahead lol 3. Why make it complicated? Why add so much stuff which is not needed or used . Keep it simple please: Truck stops with ez to see fuel price and button to navigate (let drivees use their navigation app) , etc Less swiping, clicking and closing PLEASE",2
"Gold member $100 to use the gps ??? So ridiculous, i use another truck gps app with a fantastic services and great info on POI, everything i need for half of price.. trucker path use to be so great but..... now is not even worth it.. lucky you getting 1 start.",2
Each update make it worth and worth. It is something amazingly stupid how they think truck drivers use their app,2
For years this app was free and useful.. I got out of trucking for a couple years now I'm back in it now you have to pay and no one updates it.. bunch of garbage if you tell me.. anyone know of a good app to find truck stops for free?,3
"March update bad. At first, this was just a great 👍 app. Now, there are many useless functions.",2
"1 star for paid app, it offers worse navigation Ive ever used, half of the time even that is not working. Best case scenario when is working, UI is so bad, it will cost you some nerves as well. 3 star for free option, too many ads, it was 5 stars 1.5 years ago",0
"I used to love using this app till all the updates it was simple and very easy to find what I needed I used to could put in a route and find what I needed now it's so confusing, the ads are irritating, the list to see truck stops, weigh stations and rest areas It don't show the only thing that you can see is the map and can't see list view I am looking for a replacement app the paid version is worse y'all messed up a perfectly fine app",1
When you decide to willy Nilly show places the user isnt looking for or have selected you have made it nearly impossible to find what it is they actually need to see. Thanks for ruining your ap in an attempt to further monetize a rapidly worsening app. 1/10 now would not recommend Edit: pretty sure it's not a bug. It looks like paid placement like in google maps,1
Not working,0
The map version of this app is horrible. Its tried sending me down 4 ton weight limit roads on multiple occasions. This app will get you into hot water fast. At least the mapping side of it.,0
I've called twice the 1st time I waited over half an hour before told me to leave a message and I'll be dammed if I wanna wait another half hour for another message To put it simply your customer service sucks. I just checked in again their technical staff is useless the app is Worthless and I do not recommend it at all the only thing it's good for is finding truck stops,0
Just an absolute garbage app. I cannot believe these people have the audacity to charge $30 a month for a product that does nothing of what it promises to do.,0
This app gets worse after every update.,0
No good!,0
I'm sick of the ads. This app was perfect before. 😠,0
The ads they have put on this app are making it unusable it used to be good I'm removing it from my phone good luck,3
My cc account was automatically being billed without prior approval after free 7 days. This app is terrible that's why I never used it.,0
Used to be able to see things with out going thru fifteen different things to get where u r going app sucks,0
"Suddenly it's being littered with ads. I wonder if maybe fb bought this app. Seems like they're buying all the other ones we use. Maybe time to find another one?? Was going to suggest to correct info at the Obetz, Ohio Loves Truckstop. It wouldn't allow me to. The said truckstop on app shows 100+ parking slots, they have at BEST 1/3 of that.",0
Congratulations! You've ruined a great app. You've put so many useless icons and other things on the screen that I can't see the routes.,4
Used to be a good app but now it's full of racial comments disrespectful and threatening comments and anything you post very tried to contact customer support to let them know zero communication back,3
"Just updated app can't even use it now. I dont understand why these tech think they need to go and twerk the little nuisances and to ""TRY"" and make it better. If it broke dont fix it common sense. Now it doesn't work at all",1
I'm with the other 45 reviews. More pop up ads than ever before. Almost to the point of unistalling ap for good.,0
"Since last update, crashes all the time!!! Bring back the old version!!! They want you to pay 200$ annually if you don't, the ads will suck the life out of you! I'M VERY F*****G DISAPPOINTED!",0
"By all means... DO NOT USE THIS App if you're a trucker. It will take you thru roads and twits and turns that are not for an 18 wheeler even if you set it up. It will take you on a tour of the city on your last 3 or 4 miles of your trip. It will loose signal if you try to make it work on the background, ect... If you don't heed my warning get ready to get pist, curse and go ballistic when you least expect it... GOOD LUCK",2
The app was purchased at $100 by accident. I don't even have trucks running and I've haven't been able to cancel the account or get a refund.,0
This app used to be very helpful but recent changes have really hurt it's usefulness. Even the things they were very good at are now crappy. Too busy trying to be everything to everyone.,3
I used to love this app. I am truck driver so I use it a lot. I also paid the $100.00 yearly subscription for the GPS function. But it seems to hardly work now. I liked it because it would always take me around streets that trucks are not allowed on. Please help with this information. If continues will not be getting new subscription for GPS!,2
"Use to be a great app, but with all good things they decide to ruine it with annoying ads.",4
"I have been trying to cancel this subscription since i signed up for the free trial and they have now charged me and refused to respond to my requests for support. First, their app loses all function i normally use if you are in navigation mode (which made me stop using it day 1) and the navigation isn't much better than google. I'm out of work and can't reach a soul to get relief. Customer service is less than one star as i have been completely ignored. Don't be fooled.",0
"They are crooks, wont let you unsubscribe",4
This used to be a great app. At this point it is almost totally useless you cannot do truck routing unless you pay the ridiculous fee of $10 a month and no one in the right mind would ever pay that for such a garbage app. The retards that develop this app are intentionally sabotaging it so we can no longer use it for truck routing.,4
"Since they introduced the paid version, the app gets worse and worse. Keeps crashing, says I don't have internet when I have strong signal and it's giving stupid routes which a car won't take, not speaking of a truck.",0
"used to be great, now total junk",3
They sold out to some Chinese company. Now it's full of nothing but ads trying to push you to buy the paid.. Unless app now glad there are others to replace it.,0
The app suddenly stopped working,0
"Used to be great. Now requires an account to do ANYTHING. Yet another way to suck more personal information from the user. Each update adds more and more feature creep. Whatever happened to ""just"" truckstops, weigh stations, and Walmarts? A ""lite"" version would be a godsend...",4
5 May 2020 This used to be a good app. Now it has a bunch of useless features and so many ads that I'm going back to paper maps and a truck stop book instead of paying over $100 a year for features I will never find a use for.,3
"Their pop up ads are dangerous and reckless. The app is barely functional anymore. You used to be able to use this app fairly easily while driving to figure parking, fuel prices, or scale status. Anymore with all the adds and them trying to get you to upgrade it's too dangerous.",4
THIS APP IS TOTALLY UNUSABLE EVERYTHING YOU CLICK ROLLS A 30 SECOND UNSKIPPABLE AD TOTAL JUNK,0
This app. Used to be really helpful I used to love it!!! now they want money and it's stupid how much it costs $30 a month or $300 dollars a year!!! A YEAR!!!! I'm going to find something else!!!,3
Smh what happened,0
"Pervasive ads much? This app used to be my go to, I am now on the hunt for a different app because the ads have gotten way out of hand. I know they need to make money, and I would gladly pay to remove the ads, but the paid app options are ridiculously pricy when all I want is to remove ads.",2
I didn't authorize this account transaction!!,0
Used to be great all the years before they got greedy.,3
Sorry about your ap 😔 you have turned it into trash.,0
Used for years and loved it . But now it dont work. Should have continued without all the changes,0
Ads galore and now they are starting to make using Google maps more difficult with the app. I'm sure soon enough they'll get rid of it so you have to use their premium or jump through hoops.,1
This app is worthless takes you out of route. I think you should be refuned. It has not work right for 2 months.,0
"Hello, I understand there is a paid version. I don't think....that should mean forcing people to watch an ad, or having another ad pop up when you return to the map is over the top. (Ridiculous.) There should be a darker, or colored line to make state borders (More defined.) Also, the updates since your initial launch have made the App look more, and more ""cartoonish."" A more professional, even military look would bring more subscribers... Looks like it was designed for 12 year olds.",0
"If I could I'd give zero stars! This used to be a Great app. Now they have gotten money hungry and destroyed the app. Now has ads that block part of the screen. Used to give you 3 routes to pick from, now only one and its NOT EVEN A TRUCK ROUTE! Tells you it's a car route. And the current location is waaayy off. Why call it Trucker Path. Just sad how everyone is trying to squeeze money out of truck with as much as we do.",4
Used to be the best app and tool in my toolbox now this app is completely junk. Needs to update truck stops. Has a million ads now and they runied the easy interface.,2
"Uninstalled today... I understand the app runs a route for automobiles, but sadly for some reason your routing adds anywhere from 70 to 100 miles more than the shortest available route. With your last reply, I can say that it's no longer a useful app... It's become all about getting money from memberships. Back to the book for truckstops.",0
This used to be a Great app. Knew when scales were open or Not. With upgrade? No telling at all. Hope someone comes up with New App like Truckers Path used to be !!,4
Slow inaccurate data. Can't trust this app...!,0
a lot of advertising and it is dangerous when you open the application when you drive I do not recommend this application...I try to take a screenshot but the application looks black on the picture.,0
"""Free trial"" is bs since it won't let you cancel until after you pay. And of course I can't find a phone number... Developers are getting money hungry... pop up ad crazy with ads that require interaction, some multiple times. It used to be a useful app... now I'm uninstalling.",4
"so much improvement is needed, its 2020, and I cant change something simply from 24 hour clock format to 12 hour clock format, 70% of the time, the gps doesn't give me the exit, it just says oh this is the end of trip, flat in thw middle of the highway, doesnt take me off the exit, up the road that literally the locations address is, GOOGLE MAPS, has no issue bringing me to this address, another thing, it likes to make u turn down country rds that are tight as ever.",1
Not telling me whete a truck wash is,0
"What a great idea full screen adds with audio on, and now it's crushing probably because of that. Used to be a good app, not anymore",3
"Too many ads, not worth paying for the premium, going to uninstall.",0
Should be free,0
"Too bad I had to give you a star because you don't even deserve that. Perhaps your development team could find more ways to screw up a wet dream. Just once, can truckers have an app for themselves instead of catering to the public like the truckstop do? This is so pathetic. I get so sick and tired of being looked at as a second rate citizen and thought of as a field hand slave. The public used to identify people like that by another name. Too bad nobody listens to us.",0
"Was Essential for all otr truckers... HOWEVER, the recent update of ads that play when opening and the popup ads decentivizes me (and others) to not update parking for other truckers. I've noticed the last few weeks that accuracy has plummeted. I ain't paying a monthly fee, maybe one time fee but no d*** monthly fee.",2
The ads are getting ridiculous this app is about unusable anymore,0
"This app was so much better before all the ads. Its garbage now, might as well by the book from the truck stop.",0
"Good job turning what was my go-to routing app for many years into a useless p.o.s. What a joke. Searching place names and routing to them is now nearly impossible. The map screen is filled with useless junk nobody is interested in and has zero routing functionality now. Goodbye Truckers Path. You were a great app, once; too bad you felt the need to fix what wasn't broken. Want to make money so bad, Trucker Path? Ditch this garbage version and bring back the old app for a nominal fee.",4
Was once a great app not so much now to many adds and will not find alot of places you search for I no longer recommend this app just use Google maps and a truck stop book,1
Way too many ads. it's hard to navigate anything having to watch all the ads. Very frustrating,0
Throw the whole app away 🚮,0
It tells you that there is no internet signal when you try to trip plan,0
"I don't know what happened to this once good tool for myself, but now it won't open, it crashes every time I open it. Reinstalled it's still continues to crash",2
Too many ads,0
They moved to full on pop up ads for fake games,0
"This app. Crashed on 04/22/2020, it was reportedly fixed the next day. I have been trying to upload the update for 12 hours and then deleted to start over. Its been loading, again for 6 hours and still nothing. I cleaned my drive and restarted before uploading attempt the second time to no avail.",0
Can't login to my account. Sent three messages to support the other day. No response,0
This ust to be a decent app for truckers now it sucks and trucker path wont respond to my emails. Everytime I try to use this app is says no internet connection.,2
App doesnt work,3
ADS ! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎,0
"Perfect example of ruining a good app. I've been using this app for years, now all of a sudden they're trying to do too much on the main screen. ""Search POI, address"" tool gets in the way. Too much noise on the screen to move out of the way....",1
"Everyone is capitalizing, except the drivers. Was a great app to find parking. Now, it's overwhelmed with ads. Almost unsafe when a video ad pops up as you're driving, very distracting. It nags you to buy a monthly payment, even as drivers are struggling themselves worrying about their family's finances in this troubling time. The user base has dwindled drastically because of the ads. Many parking areas have days and weeks since a last parking update, because no one is using this app anymore.",1
"This app used to be good, it ain't worth a damn now",3
"Was 5 now 1 stars. So I understand that developers need to have some ads in order for us to get app for free, but this is getting ridiculous!! What really pisses me off is that it keeps asking me if I want to buy the damn app! I literally only use this app in order to find truck parking. I don't need or use any of the other features on here. SO STOP ASKING! $4.99 a month or whatever it is is absolutely ridiculous. If you fools were smart you'd just charge a one time flat rate. Then I'd buy it.",2
"So many adds now, plus it start messing up. Use to be good one. Looking for something else",0
"uninstalled, too many annoying ads. Developer does that to get morons to pay for this. There are better and cheaper ways to find out what you need.",0
used to be great before all the ads now it wont even open,3
Garbage. Went from being best app for truckers to find parking. Now its filled with ads and constantly freezes up.,0
"So, where do I start? First, developers somehow managed to cram 32 trackers and 22 permission (according to Exodus Privacy) in this app. Holy sh!! That's a lot. Some of those are understandable like Location but most are there just to siphon off as much data from your phone. Second, there's an advertisement in EVERY SINGLE PAGE along with few full screen pop ups. TruckerPath more like AdvertPath. Also, filters dont work because truckstops pay money so you can NOT filter them out. Uninstalled.",4
Very more spam and need ad you mail... Why's I don't recommend it's bad program and not sure price on disel...,0
Are you crazy? 100$ for the app]😂😂😂 remove those ads otherwise we are all delete the app,0
This app is worthless without users and they're leaving in droves. Intrusive ads are unacceptable. See Ya... Bye-Bye... UNINSTALLED.,0
App no working,0
"Can't even open the app no more! Just keeps crashing! Navigation is no better than the Google maps. C'mon people, what have you done with a perfectly good app!",3
"Was great, ads. Ads make it impossible. Used to be a wonderful app you could safely glance at while driving. Now, 30 second full screen ads constantly flood the app making any use of it impossible.",0
App has been crashing as soon as I open it lately. Reinstall attempts getting stalled at 75% repeatedly.,0
"What used to be a great app is going downhill fast (I now rarely open it). There are duplicated pins for the same location all over the country. Information about a particular stop is often far from correct and does not seem to be edited often. Some locations, such as Loves Country Stores, simply shouldn't be present (some of these locations would be a challenge for a bobtail truck). Location reviews are often filled with questions instead of reviews. Not a trustworthy app overall.",4
Can't log on to app sent many emails to company no response.,0
Too many ads?????,0
Not going to buy an app that keeps telling me I have no internet connection when I used the internet to download the app.,3
Well it used to be usable. Since they got greedy app crashes all the time and people don't update parking anymore. Can't wait to find the next app that works as well. This one is going the way of MySpace.,0
Slow one driver will post lots of parking 2 minutes lot is full cant trust it drivers playing games,0
It's been kicking me off the last few days 😡 what the heck!,0
HATE THE NEW VERSION. NO PLACE TO UPDATE PARKING STATUS!!! as a driver not being able to update makes it harder on other drivers to find places to park,1
"It was a terrific tool before the ads, and premium cost plan showed uo. Just more greed and less usfulness. We often are looking at it for short and fast answers to make split second decisions. Go back to how your ap served our needs without ads anx youll get a thank you and 5 stars.",0
Please restore the old app this version sucks,0
No one bothers to update parking and now they are pushing ads down our throats,0
This app is such a joke now. I use to recommend it to every trucker I could but I whole heatedly advise not downloading it if u have another option solely bc of all the ads,0
"Can't update the scale status if I don't pay? 😂🤣 Y'all really tripping! The ad bombardment are just retarded. Another great app bites the dust... This was legendary, R. I. P.",4
Too many ads. This is getting ridiculous. Truckers need information on-the-fly. It may be time to find an alternative app.,0
Crashing on startup after last update. Worthless now. Too many ads anyway.,0
"This app was great when I first got it a few months ago. Since then it has gone downhill. With all the ads it was nearly impossible to use, so a few days ago I finally opted to try the $9.99 a month subscription and now since I've logged in the app won't even open! On ANY of my devices. Y'all better cancel my subscription because I can't even open the app to do it myself. Garbage.",4
Why is the app not working right now ?,0
Since the new update I hate this app.,1
sucks moose balls,0
This app used to be good. It's now loaded with ads and bloatware. Can't even use it properly.,3
In the last day the app had stopped opening. Doesn't work at all. I uninstalled and won't let me reinstall?,4
"The app doesn't even open correctly anymore. I've tried uninstalling it, and reinstalling it. I've tried clearing the cache too. However it just closes out immediately. I sent in a few reports with the system logs, but looking at the reviews I don't expect any response back. I've been getting less value out of this app over the last few months, and I think this was the push I needed to cancel my subscription.",3
App use to be amazing.. now it shutdown as soon as it opens.. fix it!!,1
"Not only does the app get worse and worse, due to more ads, more spots you can't remove that clog your map, ect. But the app doesn't even work after the newest Android update, just instantly closes itself. Garbage.. used for 4 years and it used to be incredible but looks like a new app will take its place at this point",3
"Once you open the app it shouts down, can't get it to work, I already uninstalled it and installed it and just made it worse",2
New update. App won't even try to open now.,4
"app was good, great actually. Now they want over $100 per year (nothing like gouging truckers) for features that used to be free. The app has gone downhill for the free users.",0
"Used to be my most used app. Obvious that whomever runs it not doesnt know squat about truckers. Loud ads when most of us use head phones? Are you trying to kill us? Ad when you open, ad when you click a stop, ad when you look at stop info, ad when you hit review. Ad when you back out to look for a different stop. Lather, rinse, repeat. Who's gonna pay you $100/yr for routing when we have paid a one-time fee for trucking GPS? And now it just crashes and wont even run anymore.",0
"Stsrting today this app is not usable . Having to many glitches , closing constantly by itself. It's time to move to Trackers Tools app.",0
Will not open after update,0
This app keeps Crashing csnt open it cant get anything what is going on????,3
To many ads,0
Too many ads...this was once a great app...now it crashes and ads suk,0
I can't used anymore the the app is keep stopping for some reason I try to open it put is stopping right the way,0
The app freezes alot and now it wont even come on at all,0
With new update it keeps crashing. Also way too many ads!!!!! I should be able to tell you about a new place without having to pay for something I do not need.,1
"This app, like so many others have stated used to be amazing. I use it for navigation but yesterday...the app has started crashing everything I open it. Maybe you idiots are so worried about pushing ads and getting people to buy into your services that you can't work out the bugs in your system. It's a real shame you care more about quantity over quality. In a world now that is depending on drivers more and more everyday it would be nice to have systems in place that actually cared about us.",0
I'm done with truckers path. Use to be the best app on the market. But greed got the better of them. I'll find something else to use i can't even open the app without it crashing off this last update its a joke at this point,2
This app was once good but now. Its absolutely worthless. They force so many adds on you that it crashes every time I open it. It will not even get past the load screen before it crashes. This is purely because of the greediness of the developers. You should be ashamed of yourselves. I extremely recommend not wasting your time on this app. What a shame. You went from being one of the best apps to the absolute worst app.,0
The app was good now it just crashes cant even open it I guess all good thing must end RIP,0
"There are some issues with the routing, it always seems to route 20+ miles out of the way. For instance, I was coming into Birmingham from the north going to Atlanta and the app wanted me to continue south on I-65 crossing I-20 to I-459 then come back up to I-20. And the app seems to think you can make a U-turn with a tractor/trailer at an intersection. Now today the app will not load at all. Have cancelled my gold subscription and deleted.",0
Govna pohlepna,0
App just keeps crashing. Cant even get passed the loading screen. Straight garbage.,3
"Use to be simple now you get the forced watched adds and they pop up every time you do literally anything. Open the app ADD, click on a truck stop ADD, view current info about truck stop ADD!!!! And now you get speedway stops on the map regardless of what your looking for so now you have to zoom waaaayyyy in just to get the info your looking for. This app is supposed to make a truckers life less frustrating and its doing the opposite. Iam done y'all can have it back i quit.",0
App won't open after last update - crush again and again. Ads become annoying. Seems uninstall and get other ones after 3 years of usage,4
Constantly crushing after last update. And to much of annoying commercials. People's using it while on the road. There no time for commercials.,0
"Crashing, unable to download update. Paid for subscription and still getting adds.",0
Not opening,0
All these apps are wrong will get you in trouble plan your routes instead with your atlas,0
Doesn't work any longer. Updated and it keeps shutting down. Uninstalled and installed again and still not working. Way to ruin your product,0
Will not open,0
After reading all the reviews I will not install this app thank you for everyone who has participated in the reviews it's sad that people have to use ads but thank you for everyone for their input I won't be installing this app whoever the owner of this app is maybe you should fix it and you might get some of your people back,0
Keeps on crashing. Did Swift buy them out?,0
"Was using app just a couple of hours ago, now I cant get into app. It keeps crashing and kicking me out before it even opens the app. I just updated it as well and still not opening. Please fix cuz I use this app every day!",3
"Update 4-23-29 app is complete garbage. A pox on the new owners house! I'm done wading through unending pop ups, and timed ads. The sub rate is ridiculous. To Hell with you, I'm out. 8-15-16 Works as advertised, especially when drivers are honest about the status of scales. There are a few, however that think it's a good laugh to misrepresent the actual status. Great for scouting places to park near shippers and receivers on side streets and such with the satellite view.",4
"Started Crashing all.of the sudden...sent feedback, uninstalled, reinstalled, still crashing...just started today. As professional drivers we used to love this app...now I'm looking for something to take it's place. Time to go.",0
It used to be great now it won't even load up and customer support will not answer your email,3
App keeps force closing.,3
"I too am experiencing the app crashing. In fact, all my apps that use google maps i.e. Loves, Pilot, Trucker Path are all crashing. I think it is a Google maps issue causing all this. AND...THE POP UP ADS NEED TO GO ASAP!",1
keeps closing right when you try to open it so you have to reinstall it each time! even if I paid the monthly subscription! wth!!!???,0
Was great for almost 2 years..today it froze an says trucker path keeps closing..so it updated an now only shows car routes unless i pay for the truck route this is BS..totally usless now for a trucker..uninstalling now thanks for nothing,4
App keeps stopping starting to feel like a waste,3
Was a great app until all the annoying ads took over....,4
Just like most are saying. It was once a good ap. Now removing it.,0
"I am paying for the navigation service. In the last 6 months I've yet to get a route that didn't try to take me through a residential neighborhood or do one or more U turns. Each time i can see the proper road ahead but nav will have you turning 14 times 2 blocks before destination to go through a restricted area. It also takes you beyond your destination and wants you to do a U turn. Also, turning off speed warning does nothing, constantly beeping at me even at 2 or 3 mph above. Garbage app.",0
Its terrible since you updated it,0
"I have used this app for YEARS, and when it was introduced, (1) It was free. (2) No Ads. (3) it WAS reliable. (4) again, No Ads. (5) it was easy to use, with No Glitches. Now?? Ads up the wazoo, and at critical times when you're trying to find information that you need. These little black signs pop up covering exit info and pretty much demanding that you rate a spot, or mark a location as a preferred stop (which is Utter Nonsense). Now, to the point that it wont even Load Up! Fail, Fail!!",1
This used to be a great app.. but now all of a sudden my app won't even open plus all the annoying pop-up ads.,4
Trucker path crashes now with the latest update.,3
"Keeps crashing, was great until today",0
Sucks because it won't stay open or even open. I dislike the new upgrades period.,0
"It is really helpful app,but.... those ads. And there seem to be a problem with the app, because it doesn't want to open. I uninstalled it and install again, but it still doesn't work.",3
"App keeps stopping whenever I try to open it. And to think, I almost bought the diamond package.",3
App always crashes and is very inaccurate,0
Was a great tool a few years ago to find a truck stop in the middle of nowhere but now you can't open it up without ads and pop ups pretty much saying pay me money and I'll quit sending you ads. I understand making money but be more subtle about it.,4
Приложени стало полнейшим дерьмом. Так еще и платным,0
Keeps crashing non stop. Everytime i open it it crashes,0
The app crashed now it won't even open. Looks like the ads killed it!!! This used to be an awesome tool looks like I'm going to buy a rand McNally tablet,0
"YOU GUYS JUST CRIPPLED THE APP WITH THIS MOST RECENT UPDATE! APP IS COMPLETELY BROKEN, LOCATIONS WONT LOAD, CANT CHOOSE PLACES, MAP FREEZES. WAY TO GO DIPSHIT.",2
App has stopped working for android.,0
App keeps shutting down as soon as I tap to open it,3
"Fix the app, I rely on it, it won't effing open I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app plus I've paid for my subscription",0
Now with all the ads it crashes every time you open it. Time to move on.,0
Had it for a while. Even bought the subscription but like everyone else they cant leave well enough alone. They pushed out the update and now it keeps crashing. STOP MESSING WITH IT. Create another app or something and leave what is working alone. Let me know when you go back to the last version. Subscription canceled,0
Bad,0
What's going on? Can't use this app. 😡,2
App CONTINUES to crash. I am a subcriber thinking about unsubcribing,0
"Started crashing today. App won't even open. It says, ""trucker path keeps stopping.""",4
"Crashing on Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. Even when it works, its filled with ads now.",0
The new updates have made it keep crashing. It use to be my favorite app. I used it several times a day now I cant even get it to load!,3
"Worked great before, then it got bloated with ads a couple days ago, then stopped working and shut down over and over. I uninstalled and reinstalled twice and it won't show truck stops and then shuts down. . Previous review: Most useful app for truckers. Real time user updates for parking availability and weigh stations. The number of parking spaces should be on the first page and the highway and exit numbers should be much bigger font. Wal-Mart with parking/no parking would be nice, too.",4
Have had to Uninstall multiple times. The ADS are preventing it from even opening.,0
New update just crashes over and over. Constant ads when it was working.,1
Have been using this app for a couple years now. But now it keeps shutting down on me. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it with no luck. I pay money for this app and depend on it. This needs to be fixed.,1
I rely on trucker path however today the app keeps crashing. Uninstalled then reinstalled and the app still does nothing but crash when u open it on a samsung S9. Please fix your app as its terrific when it is actually working. Thanks in advance,3
I don't know if there's been a recent update but I cannot get the app to load. This is a very important tool for truckers please fix!,2
"Used to be a great asset for drivers. Now with losing parking prediction to a paywall, incessant ads, and, as of today, not even opening in my phone I am done with it.",3
Is the app not working for anyone else,0
It's crashing started by this morning,0
It was ok and I was hoping it will be better but last few updates it is so bad I cant even open it !!!,0
Used this app gor a long time and was great. Ads are annoying at best but dont mind it. Now because of the ads and whatever feature are thrown in; tbe app crashes constantly and has become useless. Great job at destroying your app,0
The app used to be good and easy to access. Now I can't even get in to it without subscribing to the gold service. In my opinion you can now stick it where the sun doesn't shine.,3
Sucks,0
Crashes everytime I try to open app. Please fix as I pay for it. Thanks!,2
Won't even open. App keeps crashing,3
What's going on with this App just closing?,0
Sucks,0
I haven't had any problems with this app in the pass and understood a few weeks ago about the ads. But my issue now is that the app is so unstable that I have had to uninstall and reinstall 5 times in the last week in order for it to even open. Please fix,0
Crashing left and right since last update. Twice as many adds now. I get your trying to make money off this app but with the amount of crashing and adds covering most of the screen about to delete this.,0
"Impossible to use properly with all the ads, will look for an alternative",0
Forced ads. Crashes like swift.,0
Won't open,0
App keeps crashing will not open I gave it a five-star before but I took it back I've uninstalled reinstalled uninstalled reinstalled still does not work,3
App doesn't open anymore after update. Keeps shutting off,3
App quit working ?,0
This app used to be good but now is frustrating to navigate. The app is now full of ads and crashes.,3
"I've had this app for years and today, stopped working even after update. I deleted it and will find another one.",1
S9 note keeps crashing. No longer user freindly to many ads etc. Uninstalled.,0
Don't like all the ads. They get on my nerves.,0
Not working,0
New update crashed on start up,1
App wont even open now.,4
this app currently sucks and also does not work.,0
Stopped working,0
Doesn't work. Samsung galaxy s10 plus,0
"Hey trucker path I don't want this app to turn into some B***S**t social media spot I just want to know where the truck stops are what's around it and how far away am I from it that's all and an idea of how full the parking lot is stop trying to put more bs adds in to try and make us truckers pay we already get taxed enough out here don't need yall too Update: you get MORE ADDS that dam thing is more unstable, crashing as is tries to load adds ffs all I want is to see what truck stops are by me!",2
Note good app no more way to many ads on cost pay for it not worth it just like all the reviews,3
"It Doesn't even open because its trying to bombard me with ads, so it freezes the app and crashes it when im trying to do anything. Thats incredible! The ads are so bad that they crash the app. And i have a note 10 plus somebody please explain this",0
I just renewed my subscription and now the app won't even open,4
Too bad a Chinese company bought it... now nothing but adds and pay for this and pay for that.. its quickly becoming useless. Need a new developer to revamp and keep it free considering the community does the primary updates on information,0
Can't stand all the ads interrupting everything you try to do. Probably going to delete it,0
Too many ads. Everytime you try and look at something an ad pops up.,0
Used to be good now im being bombarded with unskippable ads. Uninstalled.,3
Way to slow for realtime,0
"App has gotten worse instead of better! The constant bombardment of ads when you close out details is relentless! I paid for it at one time for dark mode. But when you charge monthly for a dark mode when there is only a 1 time difference in set up, I refuse to pay for it. Good thing I have google, pilot and ta apps.",0
"Horrible. The app was working perfectly. Then, all these new updates started messing up the basic functions. Then a sleuth of ads were added, which most drivers are bound to ignore anyway. A bunch of uneccessary options are being added. It certainly does not make it user friendly for drivers and truckers. Hopefully this gets resolved. Update: The app has only gotten worse since 04-15-2020. Not only the ads that are making this worse, but the maps and suggested routes are not loading. Useless.",3
They just keep adding more stuff than is needed to this app. most drivers only want to know where and if a truck stop is available. We don't need navigation. We don't need Elog time. All we need are the truck stop status.,2
Was 5 stars before now has TOO MANY ads. Its annoying. They are really pushing people to buy their ad free version. But they can S.M.D! Gonna find a different app,0
Used to be a great app but after several updates became a carp,4
Way to many ads. Just someone else trying to get what they can from drivers. Ridiculous!,0
"Use to be a good app, now to many aids",3
You can't even use it any more with all the ads they've put in it the new owners care nothing about drivers,0
Well it recently updated and it went downhill from there being a truck driver this has been an essential tool for the work I do takes to long to get through all the adds to to use the damn app. Yes we all use this while we're driving and no it's not friendly for that anymore nobody wants to spend their afternoon on the ramp waiting for 20 minutes to get through ads to use an app . NOT Trucker friendly anymore. Looking for a replacement ASAP ( Road Hunter gps)👍 found replacement 100% better!!,2
This app was made from truckers in put now you want us to pay for our input as well as all the ads every time you move from screen to screen personally I don't see where this app is any good anymore,0
"use to be very usefull, but after this latest update (april '19) it is sooooo slow at displaying a route. My tablet took 5-10 minutes to route me from Kansas City to Milwaukee, with nothing else running. It use to take 1 minute or less. Wish I could uninstall the update because it screwed up a perfectly good app.",3
"Huh , they use our phone hardware , they use Google Maps and they use us to update the scales , rest areas , ,..etc . Jack Reports app is out , once everyone will know they will use it and without the proper updates on scales status and everything all subscribers will quit . You guys way to greedy now with all this bloated bull advertising and the 300$/year on subscriptions . We here 4 scales ,few use this for the truck route and still Google Maps is more professional all-around.",1
Millions adverts,0
"This app is overcome with ads now, completely sucks!",0
Used to be good now its just irritating,3
Ads commercials i don't do face book. Man this app went down hill QUICK,0
"I used to like the app, but now they want access to everything on your phone... Run... 4/21/20, I checked back, and now it's worse... Another reviewer said they were told to get a subscription, I have one but constantly prompted to upgrade. I'd gladly pay for a subscription if it would just go back to being good like it was.",0
"Terrible app, extremely bloated. I recommend everyone try Hammer GPS, it's free.",0
Used to be good. Garbage now that it's loaded with ad's. Anything to make a buck and people think we are made of money. I'm deleting it.,3
Disappointed with massive popup ads,0
I don't usually write reviews but I'm so upset about the direction this app is going in. I get the ads... It's super annoying but I can understand that. Every free app has ads. I'm so mad about all the places on the map that I can't remove. I loved this app because I could choose and see only the places that I actually wanted to see and it made it easy to look for places and trip plan. Now the map is crowded up with a million little places that I could care less about and they block what I want.,2
Keeps saying i dont have internet connection when i do,0
"Deleting app, too many adds",0
Sucks,0
I used to love your app. Now its just junk. Tooo many adds .useless app. Bye bye trucker path,4
App sucks now. Constant adds,0
Was good before they flooded it with ads now it just feels like its gonna give my phone a virus with the pop ups,4
"They ruined a good app with those stupid ads. How am I supposed to use the app while driving when I have stupid 15 seconds ads popping up? They hook us all on this app and they made it free to use in the beginning, now when they got plenty of users they decided to force us to pay to use the app. Greedy move, greedy bastards.",2
Too many ads now,0
"Annoying your customers with add, into over priced membership, is truly petty!!!",0
"Great tool up until recently. App has turned to complete trash with all the updates and annoying pushy ads. It use to be so easy and versatile to use for helping me trip plan my loads. Really sad, especially now that it refuses to route any trip because of ""lack of internet connection,"" which is again, complete trash!!! I have full signal and wifi access. Very unhappy now with an app I've been using for the whole 3 years I've trucking. Such a disappointment.",0
It just keeps getting worse.,0
"I used to love this app, but the constant pop-up every time I start it is too much, having to wait 10 seconds to get to a screen that tells me I have a free 7 day trial is annoying!",4
FREAKING WASTE OF MONEY,0
Too many ads. Its all to get you to subscribe to their plan. Went and bought me a GPS a one time expense vs. paying for this service annually,0
You were a good app helping out us truckers now a worthless app commercial to try to force us to buy . I may just find a new app get rid of this one since you are screwing us truckers with greed,3
"Keeps getting worse with every update. Was my favorite app now it's so unstable, will be canceling my diamond subscription and removing the app. Really is sad",0
Thank you for the latest update that makes this app almost completely useless,3
"Once the best, now filled with such long and loud ads I forget why I opened the damn thing. I'm deleting this app.",0
"As the previous 45 comments stated, this app was once great with providing up to date information. But now I am bombarded with ads over and over again and again. I open the app, there is an ad, I click on a truck stop, then another ad. I want to see parking updates, another ad. And the dev's want to say that by PAYING for the service it will provide you with a much better experience. I have used this app for over 6 years, and it was sad, but a relief to uninstall it.",0
They make it so you can't cancel during the free trial to take your money. You cant reach any help support by phone or chat,4
"Used to be a great app. Now, you can't even plan a route to see what there is for parking along the way. I'll never buy your routing, as I already have a truck GPS. C-YA !!! 4/18/20 ""No internet connection"" error every time I try to look at a trip.",4
"Used to be a nice app, the constant ads have made it unusable, really hope someone creates a decent competitor soon to put them under.",0
"Congratulations. In the name of greed or progress you guys have screwed up a good, useful app. Tell me how to remove the last two updates. You've added features that are useless. We have literally dozens of nav and trip planning apps, and the ads are infuriating. Greed is really ugly. The forum is unnecessary and what little I saw looked like a gay dating site. All I want to know is what are the scales doing and how's traffic moving. All the little tags, ads and other junk are completely irrelev",0
Once was a great app. Now flooded with adds and pushing pay subscription services. Now almost unusable!!,4
App stopped working. Uninstalled it and tried reinstalling it and it won't install.,0
Used to be a great tool to use. Lately is flooded with ads and wont connect to internet for routing. Dosent matter if Im on WIFI or Data plan.,3
Unusable,0
"Refund me my money now!!Very shady business. I signed up for a free trial of the paid service, wasnt worth it to me so I got in the app to cancel the service before the auto renewal. No place at all on the app to cancel the service. I call, on hold for over 30 minutes and the gentleman said it was taken care of and the service was cancelled. next day I get a $299 charge on my card so now I'm waiting on hold again to try to get this refunded. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS SHADY APP",4
. ITS PURE GARBAGE... went from one of the best apps to PURE GARBAGE!!!!,0
The gold package doesn't optimize truck route just shows car routes same as Google.,4
It's become so annoying with nonstop ads it's best if we all stop updating statuses let the app become useless it's too easy to pickup mic get even more accurate info,2
Terrible app. Nothing but pop ups. Way to expensive to rent by monthly or annual. Stay away.,4
Adds are out of hand! Annoying! DELETE!!!!!!,0
Too many ads. Not paying a subscription for a damn app. I wouldn't mind paying a 1 time fee like 4.99 or 9.99 but I will NEVER support an app that wants me to pay for mostly user generated data.,0
"Used to be the best app around, now it's just an ad filled pile of garbage",0
"This app got so greedy. It's full of nothing but video adds. And not the just but the last 20 updates fixed notning and then adds are now making the app crash. Its 100 dollars a year to remove adds and theres nothing worthwhile to pay for. This was just a tool to find a place to park, and they added in other features a trucker would never use. Thered still bugs from 2017 that havent been fixed!",0
"I use this app because it is useful. But continually hiding stuff behind pay walls is complete BS. In response to the the developer- I am currently a silver member, and you started hiding parking prediction behind the gold wall, that was previously available.",2
"This app was the best when it just came , now it is a joke . There are a lot of other good and free aps",0
Loved this app until the latest update. Now it has tons of ads and wants me to pay $100/yr to get rid of em 🖕,3
The ads have become abnoxious.,0
Too much ads after updates,0
Used to be a great now I'm ashamed that I told other people about it. You guys got greedy and now it's nothing but pop-up ads. The app is unusable now,3
The ads are ridiculous. I've never left a review til now on anything. Gotta go through 6 or 7 ads before you can get to the app. I went from using it daily to opening it maybe once a week at most. Whoever decided that was a good route to go is a terrible person and should be fired immediately. Honestly I'd pay the monthly fee if it wasnt so ridiculous. It costs more than my Netflix subscription.,0
"Same complaint as most of your critical reviews. Way to many ads. Hope your successful. I am uninstalling after 8 years, i think its been that long. Thank you for the many times the app did help me.",0
"This app is like a heroin dealer, they give you a ""taste"" of a well functioning app and then completely wreck it with ads while badgering you to pay for a subscription. How many times do I have to say no? I'm not paying a monthly subscription to something I use so infrequently.",0
i uninstalled it. ads on top of the screen is nauseating. This usta be a great app for drivers.,4
Constant popups make it impossible to actually rate how many spots are left and ads will autoplay within seconds of each other,0
"You went ahead and ruined a good thing. Countless complaints about the ads, pop ups and inaccurate information. Wouldn't recommend this app.",4
"Two or three ads before the app even opens. Then pop up ads every time you try to do something. Uninstaller and never using again, great way to run an app I to bthe ground",0
Loved this app for meny years. I'm deleting it now. I understand people need to make money but the amount of ads they have pop up is redundant.,0
It use to be so much better now they charge 100 annually to get app without ads . Very disappointing since half the time info is incorrect .,2
"It used to work so seemlessly..quick startup, automatically had my locations, parking, open/closed weigh stations..now it seems that every time I pull up the app I have ad after ad after ad to go through..tap on a scale to the weekly opens and closes, and BOOM another ad..and what's worse is that you have to SIT AND WAIT for the ad to clear..the least you could do is put an ad up that goes to a real game..i get better info from the CB now, and its rare that anyone has one!! I do NOT recommend!",0
You spend most of your time with pop-up ads and in order for you to not deal with it you have to pay a,0
The apps gps is awful yes the coop open or closed with the history is nice but never buy anything from the store I ordered masks 3 weeks ago off course they took the 80.00 out of my acct immediately I know I have spent at least 10 hrs on hold had 3 diffrent customer service people ask for my act numbers well I sent everything including the screen shots of the order being placed and paid for with both orders confirmation numbers all 3 employees acted shocked and promised to get to the bottom of,0
"Was always a great tool, till recently. Ever since the constant ads started, it just randomly closes the app, sometimes immediately after opening. Why would anyone even consider paying for something that poorly managed?",0
This app use to be perfect now it's just trash somebody always messing things up smh,1
I'm trying cancel my subscrition and they don't cancel. I continue with the same problem. Trucker Path said they can't cancel my subscription and said for me to call Google. I am going to have to cancel my account on the bank because Trucker Path does not cancel my subscription. This was the worse purchase I have made. Since 08/19 I try cancel.,3
This app was amazing but now with all the ads it's garbage.,0
"This app keeps getting worse and worse. Used to only have its dumb little banner ads sitting near the top, where you could easily ignore them. Now, you can't even open the damn thing without it putting you straight into a full-page ad for something you likely couldn't care less about; let alone touch any part of your screen without it throwing you into yet another ad. Find a different app. There's plenty of alternatives out there.",3
Too many annoying ads. 30 dollars a month for a membership are ya nuts?,0
"Horrible ad filled app. Every update, more ads.",0
Can stand the ads. Used this app everyday but no longer. Will be uninstalling.,0
"Thousands of ads. Extremely frustrating. The first ad last 8 sec. Then a second one comes, then a third. After that you have ads on the top, on the map ""sponsors"" and on bottom. It's also constantly remind you to buy different paid options. Frustrating, this app is now good for the G file",0
"Disappointing after all. This used to be a nice free app. Now it has intrusive ads, paywall, and it gets worse every update. Update: Developer's response ""Get a membership if you don't like the ads and want to use all the features of the app."" You can barely even use the free features the ads are so intrusive, cannot reccomend installing this app.",0
Over priced i can get most from a garmin,0
"Hard to use, all time covered commercials",0
Since they started with these ads App sucks. Seems every 5 min a new 1 pops up. I'm the with this app. Was good but now it sucks Nice job guys,0
Use to be very helpful but now it gets jammed up all the time and the ads hinder the program from working. I dont have time to fiddle with ads when I go into the app. I need to find a stop not be blocked by ads.,0
They have added ridiculous ads every time you click on something. Unistalled.,0
More ads and freezing,0
Used to be a 4-5 star app... then it got greedy and input ads,0
Very more advertisment,0
"Used to be a good app, but got money hungry. Ads make it a piece of junk. Uninstalling. Doubt if I ever reinstall. Too many ads, not paying your outrageous price for ad free. Not worthy",3
I will not be bullied into purchasing something I don't use. all the added ads that keep me from being able to use what I have for the last year unacceptable. app has been uninstalled,0
"Tge last 47x out of 50x reviews rate this 1-2 stars. I stopped counting at that point. My advice to the developers is to LOOK AT WHAT YOUR USERS ARE SAYING! YOU ARE BLOWING THIS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY! You are losing many long-time users due to your revamped app design and business strategy. I loved this app a couple years ago but now we all feel like youre a ""sell out"". My guess is u mustve sold the business or brought in a big oartner thats trying to be a SHARK. Cut back on the sales aggression",0
"This app was very useful once, now its full of spam and infested with unskipable adds...",0
Too many commercial,0
Too aggressive ad strategy.,0
"This app was perfect until they added the 10,000 ads when you're just trying to check on parking or where is the closest truck stop. Now they make you pay to remove the ads",0
Too many ads... it was great yrs ago now it just sucks dont even bother unless you want to pay,0
"Like other peeps, had it for years. They got greedy and I WILL NEVER PAY FOR THIS APP. Uninstalled.",3
After updating app just stopped booting before updating it had become add crazy have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still not booting,0
"Was great until they filled it with ads. Now it's unusable garbage. I've uninstalled Trucker Path and replaced it with Road Hunter. It's not as good as Trucker Path was, but it's way better than Trucker Path is now. The only downside is that the parking status isn't updated often enough, but that's easily solved by people switching.",4
"It was good for a while, after about a month of using it I got prompted to join a subscription plan for some added features I wouldn't use. Prompted every single time I launched the app, sometimes going back to it after my phone locks and sometimes even when navigating on the screen. Truckerpath just called me three times in a row. Didn't reject the call but they called three times until I answered. I was trying to take a nap. Im thinking of removing this software.",0
Please stop the ads!!!!If it continues I'm gonna delete this app,0
Riddled w>th popup ads on popup ads,0
"Horrible. Don't advertise a ""7 day free trial"" and proceed to charge a full month. GPS voice is super slow and outdated. Text is also impossible to decipher with a quick glance. Why are there no ZERO truck GPS apps that come close to google maps?",2
Un skippable ad galore,0
I've officially switched to Road Hunter. The Trucker Path era has ended. You killed a perfectly good app.,3
Ads and ads on top of ads. Was good not anymore. Uninstall it guys let it go its time.!!! there are others.,0
Nothing but a bunch of money hungry dicks,0
"Been using this for years. My sole purpose was planning my breaks. I dont need gps. It has been very useful. But now, the consistent pop ups of the paid options every time I open this app is annoying. I'm well aware of the paid options available. All I want to use are the basic features. This is why I use it, but if I have to wait 6 secs b4 the ad closes everytime I open this app, I may find another convenient app.",2
Seems they no longer care about trucker and now focus on taking our money. Shame on you trucker path,4
"I'm done with this app, I was fine with banner ads, but now I can't ever get to the app, on start up, I get a full screen ad that you can neither back out of, nor close after the ad plays. So the app is literally worthless. It's not worth a monthly subscription to remove ads (not that I could anyway, I literally can't access the app), especially when you rely on users to generate the update for others. Will be moving to RoadHunter instead, at least I can use it.",0
Bug you to death with adds so you'll pay them for premium,0
"Used to be great,now,adds pop up even before the map opens,then its constant pop ups at the most inopportune times,reviews are censored in location review. Uninstalled,will reinstall if they fix this dumb bs...",4
"Full of adds, can't use it with all the pop ups.",4
"Too much adds Find this app in store ""Truck Navigation, GPS - Road hunter, truck stops"" It's the same but free and no adds.",2
"This used to be a useful app, but now it's a blatant cash grab with unnecessary amounts of ads making it nearly unusable, if you are like me just using it to find parking. As soon as I find an app that let's me see where parking is I will never use this app again.",2
"Used to love this app. Used it for the last 5 years. Now it sucks! The ad upon opening is the worst! I understand needing money, but this is ridiculous! Really? An ad for wish? On a truck app? Maybe ads that would actually be useful, and not where they can accidentally be touched. We all use this app for a reason. Pretty soon we will all be gone.",4
Used to be a really good app but now the ads make it almost unusable,2
"Back in 2017 i gave this app five stars use to be the go to app for truckers. Now under new ownership i give it 1 star if i could i would give it a half a star maximum. It use to be great no pop up ads, you use to open the app and see the next truck stop without the distraction . You use to pop it open and see if the weights stasion was reported open. Now its useless by the time the 10 second ad is done i already passed the weigh station. Its not worth paying a fee for.",2
Used to be great used it all the time and always recommended it to other drivers but now it seems with every update it is like you can't really even use it unless you pay for it otherwise it won't even give you your route,3
Ads all the time. Should have stopped before introducing toxic forms. Yall are greedy. Uninstalled,0
Way to many ads,0
Its BS app with so many adds.,0
"Used to be my go to app for finding fuel prices, places to park, navigation and what there is to do. I'd been using since 2016. Now trucker path is useless unless you pay for it. Why are you all so greedy. Stop loading the app with useless ads and make it great again.",4
Stop inserting so much advertising. That's impossible to use your app.,2
Was a great app but then they for greedy and added ads,4
"I liked this when it first came out. Now, it's owned by a Chinese telecomunications company, and they are able to monitor each user, assumably truck drivers, and their every movement. I am uninstalling, and hope all my fellow American drivers do too.",0
"It was great app, now is trash with all ads on the screen.",4
This was once the best app to have if you were a truck driver; however the developers of this app of gotten greedy of course! I've lowered my recommendation to one star based on the amount of bloat they've added to this app that makes it near impossible to use in any kind of efficient manner! It would be nice if they'd release a free version that had no adware b.s. and only shows the locations of truck stops which is the only reason you will ever need this app!,2
Used to be a good app before all the full screen ads.,3
Take the ads off!! I don't want to give u my money!! Take your hands off my bank account! This isn't advertising it's torture.. shame on you for ruining the good app I really hope u go bankrupt with this way of pushing people to pay subscription!!,0
Used to be a great app until I get a new updates.. what's up with the blocking/pop up add whenever i tried to open to use this app ??!!!,4
"This used to be a good app before you got a deluge of ads in the first minute. The forums are moderated to the level of a 13 year old's vocabulary, not a CDL aged adult. Uninstalling this to use a competitor's app that isn't nearly as restrictive , offers truck routing for free, not an annual subscription, and has far less ads that are not obtrusive.",3
Used to love this app and recommended it to everyone especially new drivers but now I hate it there are more ads then youtube and now asking me to pay to use ummm NO I WILL NOT PAY it's bad enough we have to pay to park now we have to pay to find a parking spot ridiculous 😔😔😔,4
The ads are getting out of hand. Makes the app barely usable.,0
"Update, once a five star app. Now not even worth the download. I'll go back to books. I was ok with a variety of ads in this app. Some were actually useful and industry related. Now it's just full of constant popup trash. Not just when you open the app, but every third location you check a new popup. I use this daily. Although it's not 100% accurate with pricing and some drivers fail to be decent and update correctly, overall it's a great app to have.",2
This used to be a great app but now it is all about give me your money sucks,4
"This used to be a great app. Now, thanks to greed, it sucks. Looking for another similar app",4
"Ads for premium when apps start. Ads full page ads 5 seconds after that. Ads on bottom of page. Ads on truck stop info pages. Not all things age well. This app / developer is too greedy now. We truckers helped build it, now we must stop using and let it fall to waste.",0
I was willing to deal with banner ads at the top and bottom. Now they've add full screen video ads trying to get you to subscribe. I'm done. Uninstalling the app,0
The update ruined it 😒,0
I agree with all the recent reviews. Didn't feel compelled to write one myself until a couple days ago when the pop ups became so intrusive that it cuts off any audio I'm listening to and forces me to clear out back to back pop ups while I'm in the middle of getting information on a truck stop. Too bad this used to be a great app. Been using it daily for several years. Guess I have to go find a new one.,4
"Made by greedy and selfish people. This app never used to be full of spam advertisements that force you into a pay service. Top it off, all it is is a Google maps based overlay with truck stops and weigh stations on it.",4
"Used to be a great app, but now it's full of ads. Extremely difficilt to use when too much bloat pops up. Switching for something else.",4
"U have sold your soul to commercials. The commercials that take over my screen was the deal breaker. That sucks when you're trying to find info on a truck stop or checking the status of a scale. Im fine with u making a few bucks, but don't take over my screen. Sooooo I'm now looking for another app to use. Im hoping this will piss enough drivers off and we will get back to using the c.b.s properly.",1
They have intentionally made this ap worse probably to pressure me into a paid subscription. Now I cannot even find my fuel stop. Completely useless!,0
Used to be a great app. Used it for years now it's got too many pop up and no weigh stations info,4
"Once great, but no more. This app used to be perfect. Now, everything you click on pops up an ad in a sad attempt to frustrate users into paying a subscription fee. Complete waste of time in an industry where time is everything",1
App was good until they started Pushing ads like a m************,0
They REALLY screwed up this app.,0
Ads ads ads how many are enough,0
Now this app is frustrating. Too much adds popping up again and again. Asking for money. It was good at one time. Right now it's waste of time.,1
"You people have screwed up this app. I have used it many times in the past, but now, since the update, I'm swamped with advertisements galore. Then i am asked constantly, if I would like to PAY to block advertisements, plus the games that someone wants me to download. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. It was great, but now pretty much useless. I'm searching for a better app.",3
Was grate app but now it's terrible too many ads everything is dolla dolla bill yo. $$$,0
"A year ago you could afford an anual silver membership under $20 and you had night mode and parking prediction, that's everything we need as professional drivers. Now they flooded the app with ads giving you the choice to quit app or to pay 10x times more for things that you don't need. This app became popular thanks to simple drivers that were contributing by updating status on places, developers forgot that when they increased the prices on app memberships ..... so thanks for that.",2
I use to love this app until all the ad pop ups. You can't do anything on the app without a ad popping up and blocking the whole screen until the time for the ad is up. Road Hunter is another app like this without the ads like this one. Use that app and leave this one alone!!!!,4
"Used to be the go to trucker app. Now is filled with full screen ads. Full screen ad at startup has to complete its 10 second duration. First location you look at will have a 30 second ad. Banner ads used to be fine to deal with, these are just obtrusive. Luckily since Trucker path went full greed mode there is now a few other trucker apps that have stepped up and are superior to trucker path.",4
They got greedy........now the app sucks and they want way to much money for stuff we can get for free.,0
Know what's annoying? Taking 20 seconds to look to see if something is open with all the bs adds and pop ups u have to close. Use to use this app. Uninstalled it because of all the bs pop ups,4
This app was good till you tried to make it fancy... It should be a choice to decline... 1 time not every time and the accuracy went down hill,0
I used to love this app now I'm really considering deleting it because all of the adds. Definitely download trucker tools and happy with them so far,4
It too damn slow. Get ride of the ads,0
Just continually taking features away unless you pay.,0
"This app was great. Now its infected with greed and popup ads. Right when it's most inconvenient. Its sickens me to see the greed of others. Perfect example I turn the app on it starts to populate then boom an ad. I close the ad and boom another from trucker path. And just to make sure I'm serious it asks if I want to buy premium. Seriously you greedy people. I hope truckers stop updating stations parking and anything else that drives your app to success. Because without us, your app is useless.",2
Not going to pay to get fuel prices,4
Crazy if you believe $20 a month is fair,0
Used to be a good app. Now to much garbage on it. All it does pisses me off and I don't want to use it. Hardly ever use it now.,3
Closes constantly. I’ve been paying for a crappy service for months. Shame on me. I’m canceling right now,0
Too much commercial,0
"Truckers use the Google Maps Review Section Now. This thing is junk. They had a window were they could have been someone that Google bought for 500 million or more like Waze purely because of their unique demographic, and market share if they had only kept going but they got greedy too soon and now nobody uses this anymore. That's how the tech world operates. You have to be patient, or you kill the product.",1
"Used to be a great app. Used to be able to open it up and find what you needed. Now you get bombarded with ads, ads to remove ads and even more ads.",4
Quit using the app because the level of pop-up ads is ridiculous. Open the app to a pop-up. Close the pop-up to find a second pop-up. Two banner ads on the screen. Click anything get another pop-up. Monthly fee to go ad free is too expensive because of all the extra garbage services you're tacking on to pad the bill. No thanks.,1
If you can handle Ads every time you touch the screen this is your app,0
App use to be great but now way too many ads popups now it sucks,1
You took a once great app and trashed it with adds,4
It's become more of a hassle to see anything related to your route. Because of all the ads. You cant skip the ads they are timed or turn them off. Without paying 100 bucks a year. Most people never update scales on the reviews of said scales. If the app developers hadn't become so greedy with the pay for subscription and only charged 20 bucks a year with small bottom or top of screen banner ads with a feature of only seeing what a scale is doing if you updated the last scale you went by I'd pay,0
I used to love this app but i made the mistakw of paying for it which they took way more then what they said it would cost and half the time it doesn't even work or it will lose me from gps when i have full service its getting rediculous and I am about to delete and buy something worth it i tried to obtain my refund but it will not allow me to get it for something not worth it i will not be downloading this app again,4
Way too many ads! Ads on top of other ads!,0
"This app is a driving hazard app. All these stupid ads pop up while trying to find truck stop, annoying af.",0
Get your ads under control.,0
Loved this app. There are so many ads now it's ridiculous. It's frustrating to use because everytime you click on something it seems as if another ad pops up. Please make trucker path what it use to be!,2
Greed has made this once great app garbage.,4
Very irritated with the ads!!!!! No longer like this app due to the addition of the constant ads,0
"Used this app for years, paid for truck routing for months then stopped paying. Now it takes me several minutes to do anything on app due to multiple pop up ads each time you open and click on anything. Found another app that allows me to find a stop. This app is trash due to greed from the owner.",1
"nice app, but now they ad too many POP UPS, 😡👎",4
Used to be an awesome app...fuel prices are not updated lately...they are WAY off...I was paying $30 per month to get the fuel routing...it works when it wants to...less often than so...but doesn't do any good because THE FUEL PRICES ARE NOT UPDATED. What happened to this app? Did the original developer sell the app to a bunch of lazy people?,4
"New version is overrun with function impairing advertisements. Also, laggy and unresponsive. Deleting for now. Used the app a lot over the years, but the constant ads in the newest version make it unbearable to use. It seems they're pushing hard to sell the subscription. I don't mind paying for software, but the monthly subscription fee isn't worth what you're getting with this app. I'll probably come back later to see if they fix this abomination.",1
"This used tip be an excellent app, but now you can't get through all the damn ads. What junk. Went from a solid 4 star now I wish i could golly negative stars.. again it's junk",0
"This app USE to be good. Now all they did was sell out and flood it with ads. Us truckers have enough distractions to deal with, now this ? Save yourself the trouble, do not install....",1
Used to be useful. Is now so full of spam as to be useless.,0
Too many ads now and they are force fed. Will uninstall..shame was a good app.,3
"Don't use this app! Horrible, terrible .... TOO MUCH ADS!!!",2
The new update ruint this app for me... delete...,1
You want me to watch ads while driving?,0
All I got to say is FU trucker **** trying to reap off drivers with app purchase,0
The app has now become dangerous to use. As with most maps people use it while driving. Now it wants you to watch videos while driving or its functions will not work,0
"With the newest update, I find the ad screens jarring, annoying, and hard to close. I used this app regularly to help manage fuel stops and parking. Now the constant harassment to upgrade to a no ad plan makes me question why it's installed! No, I don't want fuel & routing through my phone & no I don't want to pay you to stop blasting me with sudden full page ads! After the last update, I have revised my rating to a solid 1 star. The app developer ruined this with ads on every screen touch.",0
Too many ads .... becomes to be junk,0
"Used to be wonderful. Now its riddled with ads that pop up at the slightest thought of doing anything but i dont have a choice but to use it because theres nothing else out there so u have to just suck it up. If they stopped selling 90% of the screen to ads every few seconds, this would be 5 starts, but since all these ads came about, i can barely stand to use this app",2
"The adds in this app are getting worse by the day. I open the app to check scale status, and have to wade through 2 adds, while I'm driving! If you haven't already downloaded this app, don't. I'm deleting it as it's both obnoxious and dangerous.",3
This app was great till it was commercialized. Your adds are stupid and irrelevant. Forcing to pay to eliminate the ads is moronic. Completely out of sync with the users.,0
The adds are killing the easy usage!,0
"To many ads, was a great app, now seems greedy and hard to navigate. I used this app faithfully and had the expensive paid version. No more. GOODBYE",0
"You ruined this app with pop up ads when opening app, sometimes I need information fast, not waiting for a timed ad to run out to get the info I need. I have uninstalled this app and will use other means to get truck stop info.",1
This used to be a good app but those days have passed. Now it has so many ads it's a pain to use.,3
"Owner/opp, well, now they've got ads to the point where I can't use the app without having an advert in the way... It's become more of a pain in the ass to use this then it would be to just use another app. You're reading my review you have a month to fix the problem and if it's not done I'm deleting you and searching another app for my needs. My knees are not to see your sales pitches endlessly that never go away. when I click exit on an app I don't need another one to pop up and then back to t",2
"Too many Ads, it should be a pay version. Like 1.99, 2.99...etc. We all have gps.",0
Program has pop up ads Flickr and flash which is very detracting when you're driving it has also a locking up problem this used to be a good program but it is trash now I will use the other ones that are out there that are free from now on,3
I thought this app was awesome until I recently updated and now it's crammed full of ads in an attempt to try and force me to pay. I'm moving on to another truck stop app,0
This app WAS good until it became so loaded with ads that is almost impossible to navigate.,0
"This app was nice... now they put too many ads,especially when you enter",0
Ads wreck a good experience! Used to be the best. I'm about to delete it and use something else.,0
This app is worthless now. Adds everywhere. It takes 10 minutes just to find a truck stop. Deleting it now.,0
This was a great app. Til they sold out to ads! Now you cant hardly use the app for anything without being bombarded with ads! Thank you so much trucker path for selling out!,4
That's a lot o reclame o this app,0
"This was a great app. Used it for years, now its flooded with pop ups, ads that block the screen, and will close in the middle of using it. Here's a news flash, I will never pay to use your'e app. Not when there's free apps elsewhere that do the same thing. Its was nice while it lasted, but you got greedy and now it's useless and un usable. Uninstalling.",4
Used to be an awesome app I used it for years now has too much adds. Sadly I will have to uninstall it,3
ads.ads.ads.ads. why do I all these ads on this app about to uninstall cuz I'm to bessy watching ads.ads.ads.ads.and ads.,0
"Used to be a great app, fast and easy. Now, it's just too bloated and takes up a lot of memory.",4
"Unusable. Way too many pop up ads, garbage",0
Used to be a great tool now its overloaded with advertisements..will be deleting soon,3
"Don't bother. It was a 5 star app when it was free, but now it's trash.",0
"Predatory advertising like in this app needs to be made illegal, switching to Road Hunter. I hope the dev's that crammed this app full of ads, time gated ads, popup ads and other annoying ad feces get brutally dismembered",2
"Impossible to use,too many ads,forses you to upgrade to paid version.",0
"I deleted this app today. It's to dangerous to use now. The ads are ridiculous, and wanting $100 or $300 per year is insane. If you have a good commercial gps you can find anything this app offers. It was truckers that freely gave the info that made this app special and now they gouge us. Pathetic and sad Trucker Path...",4
Thia app suck cancel my subscription,3
"Intrusive full page pop-up ads have now become animated, impossible to close for a few seconds. They are harassing you to pay. My experience with this app over last 3 years has never been 100% satisfactory. They're not getting my money.",1
Total scam. App glitches a lot and if you try the 7 day trial then cancel they still charge you anyhow. Worst experience ever with this app. Stay away.,0
"***WARNING*** USER BEWARE: App is now loaded full of spyware, malware and tons of spam advertising and forced popups. App is unusable. Latest update just doubled down on the advertising and the malware/spyware. It's time to put these clowns out of business. Make sure you double check your permissions, this app wants access to all sorts of unrelated information for their spyware. 🖕them.",3
Now we have to watch a bs add everytime you open this app. Cheaper and cheaper by the day.,2
"This used to be a fantastic and very useful app! Now it seems the makers are only concerned about making money with their stupid ads! How are we supposed to navigate to the truck stops when ads continually pop-up trying to force us to go premium? What's wrong with you people? This was supposed to be a trucker friendly app, not something that you can get rich off of while we suffer! Shame on you trucker path, shame on you!",2
"App used to be a go to after latest update you can't get stop info, can't get address of stop had to google place for it, won't allow you to send stop to google maps, canceling subscription alot of other drivers I talked to doing same. If it ain't broke don't fix it",3
Horrible update. Now just garbage,0
Was a great app until they filled it with adds,4
used to be a good app years back but the advertisements have taken over and lately been getting ads that have an unskippable timer. i can deal with the normal ads that you can x out but ill be damned if you take over my phone and tell me i cant do anything until you tell me i can...,3
App used to be good till they added ads and more other stuff because of all this stupid ads and other stupid things this app used to be for truckers now they try make money on us. I rather use other app maybe less options but no ads. NO STARS FOR TRUCKER PATH....,3
"Too many ads now, less functionality than it was before sold to china",0
advertisement. advertisement. advertisement. Difficult to use,0
The best trucking app,0
You become boring and desperate with the ads i am switching to other apps,0
This used to be a great tool for truckers. Now ruined with ad bloat trying to get us to subscribe.,3
"Sold out to a foreign entity, now super greedy for money and over ran with ads if you don't pay up. Have to click through 5-10 ads to get through anything. I'd consider paying a small one time fee but an ongoing subscription, you can forget about it. For an app that relies heavily on user input, quite greedy.",0
TOO MANY ADDS!! Constantly interrupted by ADDS! This was a great app.,4
"Slow. Does not show accurate truck routes. Will lead you through residential areas. App charges you early and WAY to much, and won't give you a refund.",4
"Update for AD, So do not update this version",0
too many in your face popup ads,0
I've been trying to cancel my account. I called several times and left messages. Now I have to go file a dispute with pay Pal. I would not recommend,0
Bring back reviews Why to remove such a important section Edit Still one star I understand that for you to exist as an app you should post ads But there suppose to be a limit In your app nou is way to much adds guys Really hope that someone will develop a similar app and with way less ads,0
"This used to be a very useful app. Now it is full of ads. Also, when trying to find a certain truck stop franchise, the app forces the user to see other truck stops that paid for advertising. When I want to find a Loves or TA, I don't want to see other truck stops still on the map.",2
"Due to greed, you have made this a worthless app now. Five ads in the first 20 seconds of opening the app is absolutely ridiculous.",2
In a time like this when truckers are so essential you go and put video ads on. Way to take advantage of the situation.,0
"Truckers app used to be a great tool for me, it used to help me find fuel stops, parking availibility, even hotels when I'm training a student, to know if weight stations were open or not. but now they want me to buy a subscription. I'm not going to do it, so your rating with me has gone down as a matter of fact I am uninstalling it",3
You have a great free app you're messing the thing up by Forcing people to purchase it,0
"Ads are overbearing. Too many, they popup randomly blocking the whole map, and some are unskippable.",0
"UPDATE! Since they've been bought out, I'm not satisfied. I've uninstalled app. Highlighted the main roads in green/yellow/red sections are great when needing to plan a detour around a traffic delay my GPS has not been informed of yet! Thanks!",0
Too much ads .,0
"I've had this app for years. I referred many drivers to use it. Congratulations you officially ruined it. Pop up adds, trying to push people into a pro version. Its garbage now..",1
"RIDICULOUS It is alive due to truck drivers, updated by truck drivers, now we have to pay for this.",0
"Ad's every time you wanna see parking, fuel pricing , even where truck stop are ,,,,,,,, THEY MAKE YOU WATCH A ADD FOE 30 SEC while uir driving down the road",0
"This app is literally useless now. We can no longer find a route from point A to point B which shows us all our fuel stops along the Route. Now in order to see a route with your fuel stops along it, you have to have one of two subscriptions - a gold or platinum membership, with the platinum membership costing $300 a year, which is utterly ridiculous. You're an app, not a freaking dedicated physical truck GPS, no screw you!",2
"App SUCKS!Slow to load.Ads after every click.Used to work pretty good, until they put in the Ad free option.Yes,I know it's a free app, but really.",0
"I remember when this app was pretty open, but they keep hiding more and more behind a paywall. Advertisements that wont go away, and they bug you to sign up for their subscription every time you start up the app. Like most companies these days, they want you to pay for them to sell your information to advertisers. Just make sure all you other truckers out there read the ToS before signing up for their premium service..",0
Just a cash grab at this point. It's very disappointing,0
"Bogged down with ads. It use to be a good app, but now it's just a waste of time.",1
This app used to be quite useful but in recent updates the pervasive ads have replaced any sort of actual functionality until the entire app is essentially just a precursor to force you into a paid version of their offerings.,3
Toooo many ads I'm looking forward to a competing app with less ads. This app is also selling info to Facebook.,2
"For the first time in about six years I have uninstalled your app because it is unusable to me any longer. You guys think truckers are made of money or something? Well, we are not. You're just another Leach on the system draining us dry of everything we earn. For a long time you were a great help and I appreciated you extremely but no longer. Good luck.",0
"Used to be a good app, now it's just a bunch of ads",3
If you want an app for ads you came to the right place. It was a great app until they filled it with ads.,2
"Why have you made this app unusable and unsafe with all the ads? This used to be a good app until you decided to get greedy by forcing all the ads. Not only that, having to hit little exs isn't safe when trying to find a place to park or anything else.",3
"Stop with the pop ups while I drive a 80,000 lbs rig trying to find a place to stop",4
"This app used to be superb until developers got so greedy, they want you to pay monthly fees plus a lot non sense advertising. People you know trucking industry is in nose dive and you come up with monthly subscription for drivers, seriously?!! We are trying to save the little we getting on the road and now you want us to split with you guys, damn...",0
"March update is terrible, not to mention hard on the eyes. looks like a kid programmed it now. looks cartoonish. slow to load, hard to find stuff now. old app was just fine-it worked. new update doesn't. KISS - Keep it simple stupid. Done with your money grubbing ways. The ads are not a bit annoying or intrusive. They are disgusting and loud. I'm deleting the app. It doesn't work that well anymore. Good luck.",3
It's so full of ads and useless things it's almost unusable,0
Adds on adds on adds,0
"If I could give it 0, I would.... ads interrupt your search for fuel prices now... every 5 seconds an app pops up and then they have the nerve to want you to pay for this bs... used to not be as aggravating... time to find another truck stop app... this one is officially garbage to me now",0
Complete garbage after the update. Too many adds to use. Shame was a great app before.,4
Trucker path must be desperate to get money because I can no longer even find a truck stop without clicking thru 5 adds and being asked 3 times to buy a membership. I was a 5 star app before trucker path got greedy.,4
Was good till they started bombarding it with adds and constantly asking to buy outrageously priced premium packages.,0
Another app ruined by greed. Latest update is full of agressive pop-up ads and other garbage.,3
Horrible new updates...... dont mess with a good thing.............,0
"Downgraded review to 1 star, the ADS in this app just make this app unusable. Used to be great app",4
Worthless app with the new adds popping up with every other click. And you cant skip them. And they are one after another. 2 in a row.,0
Before it was a great app but now it is not and that is as a result of all of the full screen pop ups commercials . This is very unsafe for us professional drivers and should be of major concern because it could have fatal results as a result of using this app with nothing but pop ups. App developer should reconsider and fix this potentially fatal update,4
It won't let me find truck washes next to my location you should make this app a little easier to use,4
"Five stars when i can hide one9 fuel networks, the way I hide the other locations that I dont want to see. I want one certian truck stop, and I cant even see said truck stops because of one9, which isn't at all a truck stop anyway and shouldnt be on here. I understand y'all need money to keep the app open and working, but damn, The ads should be plenty, cause it's loaded with em!",0
The worse option you can add to the app for DRIVERS is ads popping up on entire screen. Sometimes we have to check something during driving and those ads make this extremely dangerous. And you made this before fixing all those ridiculous bugs.,0
"I'm finally done. First it was just duplicate entries making the parking status useless. Then it was the flood of all the alternative services for which had no use. But now, on top of there being ads, the ads seem to come up every 30 seconds or every 3 or 4 times I hit a button. And to top that off, after every ad is dismissed I have to click the box that says I want to continue with ads! Which is essentially an ad for ads! I'm done.",0
The app was good before the invasion of ads. Drivers STOP updating parking and weigh station status! The greedy developers are monetizing Your DATA for their gains! Without your parking/weigh station updates they have nothing to monetize! Try the Road Hunter app instead.,2
"Used to be good, too many ads now",3
"It used to be great but now it's inundated with ads and the forum is ran by commies who love to suppress your freedom of speech ... The subscription part didn't improve things either because the routing was completely wrong and the ELD is not user friendly, it's a major joke... DELETE",3
300 dollars for paid version?! You guys are scumbags.,0
Horrible,0
"I like it,but when I hit on one ,I always get one I did not want. The map moves when I hit on anything.",0
I am not paying to used this app it was made to be used as a free app for truck driver I only used it for the truck stop and wash out location so take down the ads please,0
Was a good app until they decided to constantly fill the whole screen with adds.,3
Just wanted to update a Rast area. Had to wait though 2 ads and a pop-up. Unbearable. Uninstalling.,0
I never even used this and have been charged for it. Currently disputing a claim,0
"Had to edit my review, it WAS a good app...now it has so many pop up ads its unusable unless you pay 20 bucks a month...absolutely ridiculous...you could atleast use it before now it's almost impossible",0
I'm giving this 1 stars because even when you pay for it you still get adds EDIT JUST GOT CALLED UP BY ONE OF YOUR REPASENATIVES THEY TOLD ME SILVER IS GIVING THEM ISSUES BUT IF I WANT I CAN UPGRADE TO GOLD FOR ONLY 99.99 A YEAR. YOU CANT GIVE ME A PRODUCT YOUR OFFERING SO YOU WANT ME TO DROP ANOTHER 99$ ON THE SAME PRODUCT FOR A FEATURE I ALREADY PAID FOR??? Then when I laugh your rep just hung up on me...,0
So to get this straight. The primary purpose of this app which doesnt work without driver input...you now decide to post annoying ads and offer to charge those drivers who make your app work to get rid of the apps. Bravo,3
Owned by Chinese Renren. Beware. Too many ads. Forces account creation to do too many things. 我不会给你们我的时间还有我的钱。,0
"On the bandwagon for this app being ruined, full video ads are going to really screw one of us drivers. Uninstalled",0
It use to be a great app! Now it's nothing but ads and wanting to charge$. I've noticed less and less updates are being posted as well.,2
"No one beats this app. Update: 1 star for TOO MANY ads, I know you need to make money to keep the lights ON, but there is a limit.",0
It's not free as described. Navigation comes with price per month,0
What's with these ads and charging for memberships? People are going to start deleting the app.,0
Time to find a new app. Someone is going to die trying to clear the ads to see the parking status,0
turned into trash with ads that bombard you so you basically are forced to pay.,0
I just deleted this app today. It was one of my favorites but recently they added so many ads that it is now easier to Google the info than to use this app. I'm sorry to see it go but I don't need to fight with ads and popups.,2
Ads are out of control. This used to be a great app. Will be looking for a replacement.,4
"The ads in the newest version are extremely invasive and irritating. I have to go through 3 adds from outside advertisers or from the developer begging me to upgrade before I can use it, only to deal with adds a couple minutes later...",0
"This used to be the best app for truckers out there. We were local drivers and haven't needed it in about a year. Now I can't even find truck stops because the app won't load the map until it loads a full screen ad. Satellite views are gone, so now you need to switch back and forth between Google maps and Trucker Path to see what the parking area looks like, or how tight it is. They're asking for entirely too much money for what is essentially an ad blocker on a crowd sourcing app.",4
Unusable thanks to the ridiculous amount of ads. All you have is crowdsourced content and you're scaring the crowds off. I only thought to write this review because I saw tp while searching for an alternative.,0
use to be good. now they want your email to use it send you unwanted notifications. ADS ADS ADS UNINSTALL UNINSTALL,0
"Great app until the developers became greedy. It's useless because you can't look for weigh stations or anything for truckers unless you pay the 29.99 monthly rate. We were able to use it to look for parking spots and weigh stations along the trip. With the economy in the shape it's in, we don't want to pay",4
"DRIVERS: If you miss what this app used to be, I strongly urge you to check out Road Hunter! Spread the word! That said, this app used to be good, about a year ago, but the app is now plastered in ads and splash screens. The code is so bloated that it's no longer the snappy app we used to love. They may have improved navigation, but you're gonna pay through the teeth for their subscription tiers. You're better off with a Rand McNally GPS/atlas and a solid nav app (Sygic Truck?) for your phone.",3
It got ads keep poping up when u need to see what ur liking for and i had this app for years now u got too pay for it to ads free thats y i deleted it,1
"So many ads it makes the app aggravating to use. It used to be a good app it is not the banner and that are so bad. It is the continuous pop up and that cover the screen until you find the little ""x"" to make it go away that make the app pretty much useless..",3
Your app is worthless it doesn't show the blue dot telling you where your going it starts me out in Berlin Germany everytime you update this app nothing seems to work it worked fine when I started to use it but now it sucks really bad stop updating your app it doesn't work right I'm giving up on your app everytime you update it some thing never goes right please keep it as before This app is worthless Had to restall it and it isn't working Thanks alot,3
please bring back the old app before all the ads and the bonus features. You claim to be listening to people who provide feedback but just about every review I see states they want the old app and not all this new garbage with 20 ads to fight through. This once 5 star app is now reduced to negative 5 stars. Edit: I refuse to pay for app that was easy to navigate with minimal ads and was turned into a clusterfuc#. It shows you will do more of the same in the future and want more money for less,3
Used to be awesome...now don't work and too many ads,0
"Don't like it, any more",0
Absolutely horrible. Was good. Now there are full screen ads. Ads that play video. This p.o.s. is trying to make me lose my license - playing video pop up ads! Close one then another and another come up. Ads are also taking up screen space on the map display. I had been using/contributing to this crowd source app for 3 years. Uninstalled today. The money grubbing p.o.s. has forgotten that people who freely contribute information made this app worth using.,1
The new ads that show up really slow down my phone. Also sucks I gotta watch an ad everytime I pick a place. Use to be so reliable.,0
Govna pohlepna,0
"Since last update, spammed with ads. Nearly unusable. Dont make sense. Used to be a great app for a long time, now they must be money hungry",4
To many ads. Was nice before.,0
Again this site is a failure. The button to update info wont come up,0
Why am I getting ads if I am paying $10 a month?,0
"You can't even check truck stops between the ads block the whole screen, the ads blocking the edges, and the ads littering the map. With the reviews from people who did pony up, I don't see why I'd burn that kind of cash for nothing. On to a new parking status platform.",2
"Loved this app, but ads have become too much, and I'm not spending money on an app I rarely use. I don't see the value in my business. I'm all for developers making money, but if I'm using the app, it's because I need information NOW, not after an ad. I'll remove this app and go back to trucking as I did over 20 years ago. It's still trucking.",2
Too many ads I can't get on trucker path or the ads,4
Too many ads,0
This has become a terrible application. I wish new similar applications to send it to oblivion.,0
Too much ads 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎,0
TRUCKER PATH HAS BEEN OVERRUN WITH DISGUSTING TROLLING PEOPLE AND THEY ARE ABLE TO POST DISGUSTING PICS AND THAT IS WHY I CANCLED MY SUBSCRIPTION!!!! SCREW TP AND WHAT THEY HAVE BECOME!!!!,4
Fue buena pero ahora no tanto,0
They banned me for no reason what so ever. Tells me to message them and they have no way to do so. Its a bunch of guys posting gay porn and thats ok. But real truckers that post things about trucking get blocked and their post wont stay up very long. The app is a total joke. Ran by idiots that think the use of the N word is ok if you spell it slightly different. The app should be used for trucking and not your gay porn and your foul mouths. Waste of money. It used google maps to route you.,3
Advertising sux=loosing users=loosing weight station updates,0
"Too many ads. I understand needing revenue, but there are way too many ads.",0
I did like it.... now it's nothing but one big AD you can't even do a quick check for the nearest truck stop without getting 2 or 3 ads Pop up... time to look for a different app,0
This used to be a great app. Now it's loaded with commercials and advertisements and places on the map that that I don't need or adjusted my settings for. You turned a great app into garbage. Good job. Uninstalling,4
The updates made this app useless,2
Was great till I started receiving a bunch of ads 🖕🙄🖕,0
Too many ads. Made the app slow and useless.,0
"Used to be good...now, not so much. Every time its updated it looks nicer, but functions worse and worse. And the quantity of ads have gotten out of hand. Now they are even putting ads INTO the reviews section, and making them look like 5star reviews until you look closer. Now you can't take the markers off the map for the One9 fuel places. Makes map way too cluttered when I need info. Just keeps getting worse.",0
Sucks way to any ads... Go back to the old app what a joke. Devs should be ashamed,0
"Used to be a great app, used it continuously. Now the have a video add scrolling at the top continually; and if you want/need to see status of a location, be ready for a few ads to pop up there as we, including the purchasing of the app as well again.",4
"Utterly useless now, all we needed is to know what parking is like and exactly what truck stops are in between, I can't even search a route, like seriously I can't search it all, it's just brings me to a page for the gold package, going to try once or twice more but if I still can't search the route, deleting",2
What this app needs is a function to drop a pin where ur at for all random roadside inspections going on...not just scale houses .. be nice to see areas that are hot spots for random roadside inspections.,0
"Junk app. Sad, this used to be AMAZING",0
They refuse to cancel the subscription and keep charging my account!!!!!! And provide NO REFUND,3
Can't unsubscribe,0
Used to be a great app.Now they are getting greedy and want their hand in the pot just like everything else in trucking that isn't a driver.What do I mean by that?Ads about their premium montly subscription service and its annoying as hell as it pops up on the screen as Im trying to use the dam app.They even called me on the phone stating that I was interested in it?Like really Im pretty sure they call everyone that has made a free account with their phone number attached and just say that BS,3
Another great app RUINED by greed! And what happened to all the Love's...they don't even show up anymore. Disappointing...,4
I use this app for a long time but now ads are covering important information I guess it's time to look for a new app this app has gotten worse now has full page pop-up ads unusable,2
Dont work half the time cancelled,0
"Used to be a good app, now it's useless. Nothing but ads popping up right when you need to see something. Don't waste your time, get a different app.",3
This app has really gone to hell with constant ads including their own ads trying to get you to buy their navigation. As for the ELD- a sales rep was practicly hounding me to purchase it and I checked FMCSA site and I'm thinking they quit the service. Good thing I didn't buy that ELD. STOP the distracting ads. Were trying to work out here.,0
"It used to be great, but now it sucks!!!!",3
"So many ads...by the time you wade thru them, you're past or beyond what you needed to check. Not easy for the quick check of the scale houses. Will be deleting after years of use.",0
Frustration because it put out so many choices it makes it too complicated to understand each item,0
I have used this for five years with no charge I'm not going ti pay now this was real mean of you when the app no is worse now than ever,0
I used to love this app but now with the over load of advertising on it I'm thinking of getting rid of it.,4
This used to be the best truckstop app. They have ruined this app with their ads. Greed to sell ad space. Time to switch to another. What a shame.,2
"This app used to be great, but since it's become inundated with ads, it's no longer useful, it's simply become an annoyance, and I refuse to pay ten dollars a month or one hundred dollars a year to get rid of ads. Shove it.",3
Too many ads app wont even run with all the ads that pop up. It used to be a good app.,3
"Was a good tool, I used it as a general overview of possible routes, now you have to have a ""package plan"" before it'll do anything. Wanted a free tool as a back up to my GPS, if it wont do that than I have no use for it.",0
Get more ADs,0
Completely ulsess unless you want to pay for it. Used To be a great app now it's nothing but adds,4
"Full of ads, the forums are a joke. Tp aka toilet paper needs to be flushed",0
"You want to charge for everything, useless.",0
This app was good but now there are so many ads it is almost unusable.,0
"Everything worked ok for the most part until the last update messed everything up. Navigation button is useless unless I force stop and restart, voice prompt comes on whenever.",0
Advertising pops up when location balloon is taped. This interferes with the driver when doing his job.,0
"This application was very useful before recent updates. Now it almost impossible to use it. You can't find desired truck stops, because there's a lot of ads' markers. You can't just uncheck them. Oh and it's not all. Tons of add banners and windows won't let you do your thing, before you waste couple minutes on closing them all. I understand, app must be profitable, but developers went too far for their greed.",4
"Went from a great app to absolutely garbage. Too many ads now and I cant just have weigh Stations shown, has to show a bunch of other stuff no one is looking for. Thanks for ruining the app",4
Sucks. Slow slow. And crashes.,0
Freezes a lot,0
It is almost useless now since almost everything is a paid function.i guess they don't make enough of the adds and have to sing the drivers that make their app even needed.,0
In the last month this app went from a must have tool for truck drivers to almost completely useless. The routes from one point to another are never the most ideal path. The ads are a nightmare. I assume they dumbed down the free version so you'll pay for whatever garbage they want you to. No thanks.,0
"Forum is limited and highly ""guarded"" (unless you are a troll)",0
"Getting spam calls and text from people from the app trying to sell me stuff. Update, got a add for a sec worker web page. Srsly?",0
Is getting worst and worst this app...,0
Ad input has ruined this app. Load time and functionality have decreased tremendously and ads cover all content. I would rather delete this app than use it again. Will update if fixed.,1
I have just filed a police report for repeated harrasing texts and phone calls. This company is incredibly shady do not download this app.,0
I am being bombarded with text messages from the people involved with this app. I have asked repeatedly for them to stop contacting me. I would recommend not installing this app!,0
Ads are killing the app,0
"The navigation is horrible if you use ""truck routing"", the forum/chat is so full of trolls and yet heavily censored against what some can and cannot say. Absolute garbage. Don't waste your time and certainly don't waste your money just to get rid of ads. What a joke",1
Can't type a destination,0
Used to be the best trucking app. Now with all the ads and all the extras it's just annoying.,2
"Make trucker path great again!, all we need is truckstop/fuel locations and parking, shower, fuel prices., weigh stations open or closed, that's it! Nothing else",4
"Relentless adds for premium service, text messages and even phone calls for ELD services have made this app almost useless. I wouldn't recommend to my ex boss and I hate that fat bastard",2
"I do not recommend anyone a very bad service, they only need your money after do you pay ,no one picks up the phone.",0
Program written for truck drivers with all truck related components requiring money to access. What was a decent app is now a waste of time. You can get more accurate and more useful information from other apps.,1
"Now it's useless, deleting it after 5 yrs, a couple of years ago I had stopped using it anyway because it was going bad but now it's worse. I'll just find other ways to find what I am looking for. So much info we provided these people and they turn their backs on us. UNINSTALL.",0
"Don't bother. This used to be a good app but they screwed it up. In their greed they made it unusable unless you give them a huge chunk of money. You're on your own now driver, just really on your GPS and the Love's/Pilot app to find stops.",3
"Terrible support. Also the app was showing a few routes I could drive on, to get to my destination, but knowing the area the bridges I would have crossed were not rated for my capacity loaded. REALLY TRUCKER PATH!!! Emailed them Jan. 31 2020 to cancel subscription. They emailed back 25 days later, and after the next payment ran for the app, They emailed back. Roger and out Trucker Path... wont recommend all!!!",4
"Congratulations, you've made this app COMPLETELY USELESS. The poi's won't load in at all now. You had a good thing and ruined it. Uninstalling.",0
When this app first came out it was simple and great to use I absolutely loved now is gone really bad. Dont get me wring they have to make money but the could have kept it simple and its called trucker path why would you have a car route and make us pay for the truck route??? Had to uninstall☹,4
This WAS a great app. Now it's overloaded with ads.,4
It's unfortunate,0
This app has gone down hill.,0
Money hungry without respect,0
"Horrible connection, trying to cancel and can't, having to go to my provider for assistance to remove my credit card information!!!😡",0
Do u know thst its very dangerous when it comes to turning off your stupid adds while driving ?,0
Not worth the price. It has to be a good somewhat reliable but the other reviews are right. They became greedy. Just to plan a trip which use to give you the option to pay now they make you,0
Killed by ads,0
"This app is now cost a lot of money to use it, I suddenly deleted app and reinstalled it but I didn't know it cost money, I will install different app now. Stay away from this app.",0
Deleted this after getting a bunch of full-screen ads WITH AUDIO jumping out all over the place. Once upon a time this app was useful. What happened to it?,0
"UPDATE FEB 2020: I originally gave this app four stars. I used it every day. I have now downgraded it to one star and am uninstalling it. The ads have become ridiculous. When you start it you have to Wade through three or four ads. That won't even let you X out until you watch them for 5 seconds or so, then before you can do anything you have to Wade through even more ads. I don't mind unobtrusive ads, That's how developers support themselves. This is Just beyond ridiculous, though.",4
Holy adds balls. Used this app every day until now. Can't believe another one bites the dust. So much for good free apps,0
"App went from being a great help for truckers to nothing but a major pain in ass to find anything. To many stupid ads, demanding payment or subscription to get rid of these ads. Not worth it.",0
Used to be a great app. I gave it one star because I can't give it -5 stars. They've got so many ads now that the app is useless!,4
"Here is my review for trucker path!!! This was the app i was using and almost working for them everyday single day last 2 years. It was telling all other drivers if truck stop has parking lot or if weight station open or not bluh blh blh. Now they are calling me and asking to work for them like last 2 years and pay them 10$ a month. No thank you, i will use my radio to ask other drivers.",0
"It used to be helpful, better off using Google maps these days tbh",1
"Use to be one of the best apps out there for truckers. It now has some of the most annoying, in your face ads I've ever seen. New UI is confusing. Its all about membership now. Not sure what happened in the last year or so, but total junk now.",0
Remove ads at top of map. Remove equipment sales places. Give back the 2hr parking prediction and history. If drivers want more than a 2hr prediction window at a time let them pay. Having the ability to see history and prediction is valuable to drivers that run heavy traffic areas.,0
Chinese overlords have ruined what was once a great app,4
"This app used great. Keyword ""Used"" to be. This app used to tell you current weigh station statuses and parking statuses. Now we have to unlock them by paying for a monthly subscription. Newsflash this isn't the only app out there that tells how much parking is readily available or if a weigh station is open. There are other options where they won't bombard you with popup ads, and they most definitely will not charge you for useful information. To me paying for a subscription isn't worth it.",3
Too many ads,0
Another perfectly good app ruined. The app used to be simple and easy to use. Just wanna see what is available for parking between points a and b. I don't want all the hassle of planning a trip. I already have a truck GPS so I don't need the app to fret over the route not being optimized for trucks. I have my hours of service under control. I don't need TP to watch it for me. Drivers have made the parking updates unreliable. Might as well go back to trucker tools.,2
Terrible,0
"Well I've been using this app for a long time and gave positive * in the past but now you have gotten greedy like so many others before you. $50-$200 a month from us is just beyond the ridiculous. Full page ad takeover will get you deleted quickly in this industry, as when we need quick results in a pinch we don't need to be distracted by full screen ad takeover.. there are entirely too many apps out there to fulfill our needs to put up with your arrogance and greed.. farewell 🤔",2
I see every single review here which been responded from trucker path company! Looks nice but I was trying to reach them for over 4 months. Nobody answer phone and nobody responds right to your email! This is a fraudulent company better to block their charge from your phone I called Verizon & took care of it. You really must be stupid to even think you need this app!,4
"Completely fraudulent company! Worse customer service ever exist! If you are a trucker you need a GPS not stupid app with it's stupid interface like this! They evaluate their company more than $ than it's worth it! They say call this # or email us but there is no way to reach them! I block them from my Verizon account. They tell you go to tab ""Me"" then tab ""privilege"" to cancel account but I sent them picture of the tab which is not existing! They even don't know how their interface looks like.",2
"Adds causing screen problems, when turming screen sideways I lose location I have +/- thats it when asking about scale info. i can press open or close but thats it screen to large no done too press.",0
Sell out,0
Since the updates it is very difficult to use on the fly.... Too many ads 5 clicks to get to a map.. As if some 12 year old was told to fix this so we can make more money from people in need of quick reference... I'm looking for an alternative... DELETE APP....,0
"After they updated this app. It's now all ads before you see if the scale house is open. HORRIBLE APP NOW, THEY WANT MONEY TO SKIP THE ADS NOW!!!!!! NOT RECOMMENDED",2
Just greedy...Looking for something else...,0
"Ads, ads, and more ads! They Interrupt everytime I'm on my phone. The worse part is they even sent me an email saying I've seen 280 ads but have interacted with none. That's because I don't want to see any!!",0
"Have used the app for awhile and never minded helping out other drivers needing information. Now the same information I want to give ,is costing money to see the results?? I am afraid that you created a great original app but someone has become greedy! Just a suggestion but maybe a one time fee would not be as bad?",0
"Ruined! As if they couldn't make worse than it was. Now ADVERTISEMENT when you load it. ADVVERTISEMENT when you look at the map. ADVERTISEMENT when you select a truckstop. 2 ADVERTISEMENTS when back out of a truckstop. No longer can you use your own navigation and you're FORCED to buy their premium routing for outrageous $100 year. What a waste. You cannot use Google maps anymore or any other map app. You guys suck! Don't say they ""worked hard"" to make this app, THEY BOUGHT IT & THEN RUINED IT!",1
You guys suck I cant even update!!,0
Used to be a great app but with all the ads it's not safe to use anymore. I refuse to pay for any app. I guess I'll be looking for another app to use,4
Why this is not working as free of cost for 1st time user . This is asking for gold membership. Totally disappointed....greedy people.,0
To Many Ads!,0
"I used to really like this app, but now the ads are very intrusive. Some ads are unskipable, and are very annoying. A lot of the comments on most places contains very toxic contents.",2
Pay for it? Really?,0
Used to be free. Now they are money hungry. Uninstalling.,0
Your update sucks. Places and icons dont show up on map! 02/2020 This is now the worst app for an over-the-road driver to use you've added way too much nonsense can you go back to the simpler version? I'm not paying the subscription for your lack of services and ads! That's why I have A GPS and Road Atlas.,0
"Everytime I click on something I get not one, but two ads. You could've have made it more aggravating, and I hope another developer makes a similar app to where your greedy company goes under.",0
"App use to be a life saver. Seem they gone corporate, they want you to pay for membership, if not your get hit with ads to the point you can't quickly check it for information while rolling. Its being uninstalled. Trucker Tools it is.",0
Get rid of the damn ads you screwed up a great app,4
Too many ads,0
"Used to be a great app, but all great things must come to an end. As always greed has taken over and now the app is nearly unbearable with ad spam, which is incredibly disappointing as this used to be the app you'd pull up real quick to check for a quick restroom stop while rolling... That's no longer a safe option as you have to click through 3 very small X's on ads everytime you open the app. Id recommend searching for an app hosting website and downloading an older version of this app.",4
"This app use to be good. But now it's slow as molasses. It's taking longer than usual to load due to all the pop up ads. Not worth the paid version either. Still taking to long to respond. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a 0(zero) and an A for effort. 👎👎",1
"Up until recently this was a great app but with the resent update it's mostly useless garbage. I won't even start with all the useless advertising that now pops up like the one for local drain cleaning. Really, I'm driving a truck people. If I lived here I wouldn't be looking at the app because I would be home. New change makes it impossible to use google maps with this app and the garbage navigation they are force on us is useless in the real world. I'll be using the truck stop apps now.",1
Ehmm... can you add more ads? Moooreee!,0
First of all the app will not let me set up a route. Travel to my destination.,0
This was a great app until the cheap bastards decided to start charging for it. 50.00 a yr. I don't think so . Pop up adds galore.,4
Too many ads. Very annoying. A simple task of checking the weight station became a struggle of about 10-20 clicks through all ads that pop up. Hate to uninstall it but there are still better alternatives out there.,0
Here again you've updated the app and you should have left it alone. It was working great again. Now you've got it all messed up. Don't try to fix what was a good thing. You're all messing with what was a good thing. Stop it.....,0
With the new update where they will help plan out your trip even with best place to fuel I was in. But the breaks openly admitted to violating hos to get you to. I have tried to set the fuel places for where I can fuel at but still will not tell me to fuel there only and places i cant fuel at so it does me no good. I use PFJ and Loves but it keeps telling me to go here to BFE and get fuel. So I'm out unless you can fix this.,1
"I used to love this app. It was free and now everytime I open it it always pops up with a ""Go gold"" ad. Why would i pay for a app that is user based? If it was a one time 10$ deal okay I can see it but not every month. I hate how someone has to get rich off of an app that almost all of the truckers use cause it was the most reliable. Highly upsetting.",3
Need to update the update. Can't even access the app.,0
Great until i updated it..now its useless..looking for another app,0
The more they update this app the worse it gets. Newest version is difficult to use and so far I can't get it to make a route. Guess I'll have to see if there's a different app that works like the old one did.,3
Not perfect with scales that open and close often. I also would like to see some handsfree voice commands to make it more user friendly while driving. Thanks. Update: since their last update the app is not user friendly. Wants you to sign in now and lots of pop up adds. Acts like malware. Sorry but it has to go.,3
All updates made by drivers and you want to charge us $$ for it?))) Shame on you and your app!!!!!,0
"Used to be the best app, but anymore not even close now!!!!",0
Newest update has ads all over and begs for a overpriced subscription. Almost not worth having anymore.,0
"I'll never subscribe because most people won't. Which means loss of live engagement. I think it would have been better to do what wikipedia did to ask for donations... If you guys kept the app free and just said, ""In order to continue developing and competing in an ever-changing industry, as well as not lose participation and engagement on the app we need your support. Our developers are working hard to bring the latest best technology to you and are underpaid, please donate."" then I'd donate!😊",0
Should be called Car Path.....charges a reoccurring fee for truck routing now.......I hope they notice the steady rise of 1 stars and complaints and rethink where this app is going....it was good once upon a time.....not so much anymore with consistent ads and fee now👎,0
"i used the app for just a couple of months last year and disconected it because it kept loosing signal, it never recorded the right amount of miles , and it kept failing .i got calls a few times and i said i wanted iut. finally they called me in december and told them to remove me and not call again. but to my aurprise , i rind that they chaeged my card yesterday. so, not only it doesnt work, but they keep chaeging your card after you cancel , even when you havent used their services .",0
"Changing my review to one star. Advertisements on the free version used to be non-invasive. Now they throw advertisements up anytime you try to do anything on the app, and once you find a way past full screen advertisement there's a screen holding you hostage by a silver or gold subscription filled with a bunch of junk that I do not need. Thanks for putting profit over service guys, I'm uninstalling and using proprietary truck stop apps instead",0
Garbage!!!! Ads and Ads that's all it is can't open any of the features without getting bombarded with ads its use to work really well in a pinch just open it up a and boom info now you have to go through 4 different PAGES of ads and the constant upgrade requests and free trials. It use to be very useful now it's a joke uninstalling this garbage. Save your the space on your phone don't bother with this.,0
I want to cancel my account.,0
Not free,0
Just another app that wants money I'm old school I don't need it I am deleting it right now,2
Not the app it once was,0
Worthless unless you subscribe,0
This app use to be very good but now it wants me to pay for it. My husband is a truck driver and I am on the road with me and we use this app all the time. Needs to go back to the way it was before and leave it alone. This app use to be very helpful for the truck drivers.. but now all you can do is look at the stops unless you want to pay.,1
"Can't get this app to work at all, it used to be an awesome app",0
"Everytime I leave a critical review, the app crashes. Imagine that. Just remember this app is an ad, not a services directory",0
"Used to be exceptional, just find a truck stop 2 presses and google maps would take you there, now there's ads a mediocre GPS, and basic features locked behind a subscription. Just lame",1
"Unfortunately T.P. has become like many other apps.... they rely on free input from drivers about location status ( parking availability, scale status, etc. etc.) while simultaneously wanting to charge you to get that very information back. I have an idea... pay me every time I update a location status for you T.P. , then just deduct what you are wanting to charge me from that. Sounds like a win/win for both of us.",0
"This app used to be great, now I can't even use the search box because of an ad. I used this app faithfully to plan all of my trips and rest stops. I do not want to try your 7 day trial. I'll be uninstalling if nothing changes.",3
"Ads ads ads ads ads. Now they want money to get rid of adds. I used find this app very useful. However, I don't think it's right making people login to leave a review of a place.",0
So close to deleting. The ads and half the features are pointless. If it's that big of a deal then make an app just with the locations then one with premium features.,0
App was great until pop up advertising started occurring. If they weren't necessary from the beginning there isn't a need for them now. Keep ads as banners and not pop ups.,4
Why do toy have to make an account and sign in to leave a comment? I don't get that. Reviews that deal with DOT should be anonymous. The adds are straight ridiculous...!!!!,0
"The app started out good 3 years ago, now it is not worth being on my phone.",0
I hate this app it's the worst y'all keep changing the settings on the app and it's making it harder for just leave it alone like it was to begin with and stop with all the features we don't need them,2
Oops something went wrong please try again. The only thing I have seen on Trucker Path the last few days. Doesn't load any screens. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times...,4
Tired of the f'in ads. You cant do anything in this app anymore without being harrassed by ads. What makes it worse is that the ads are for games and other irrelevant junk. I refuse to pay for this app. What makes the ads sadder is the tech team says it helps pay to keep the app up to date. How does free games that are essentially the same thing as this app (pay if you want) help pay for future updates? Personally this app has turned into every other play store app like this and that's junk.,3
Used to be good. Now full of ads snd junk. Uninstalling today.,3
Great app ruined..,4
the website didn't specify that I will be charged I was under the impression that I was using the free app just to see how it is,0
new version its really bad for use,1
DO NOT AGREE TO UDATE ITS TRASH,0
"Update: I posted this review and they responded telling me to do the free trial and see if it was for me.... Point proven! It's an ok app, until the last few weeks I enjoyed it but now they went from banner ads to full screen ads that you can't skip! In the last 3 years this app has been pushing more and more for you to get the paid version and becoming more aggravating to use over time for the free version. Hell playstore rates it as #3 highest grossing app so that should tell you something...",4
Locks up,0
"Started out the app was ok. Trucks GPS was down for a week so I needed some kind of truck friendly routing. All the good reviews I might have given the paid version got thrown right out the window yesterday. It was trying to force me to take routes through roads clearly marked with low weight limits and would refuse to route me down actual truck routes. Even tried to send me down a gated up, overgrown service road at one point. Now I sit waiting for someone to answer the phone so I can cancel.",4
The app is mediocre at best. Keeps asking me to rate it which I already did. Keeps asking me to share it which I already did. It's missing quite a few truck stops and DOT scales. I'm tired of their pop up ads on pages I'm trying to view. Also too many ads now and too intrusive on privacy. Always asking for personal information. I uninstalled it today.,2
"The best trucking app. Sucks now that you cant use google maps to navigate,",1
"Do not pay for this app. It crashes all the time, ignores settings and does not actually optimize for big trucks. I got stuck on a back country road in Wisconsin and it cost me 750$ to get towed out. This is a horrible app and I will tell everyone I meet to delete it if they have it. If there was a way to get a refund I would but even that is not worth the hassle. Complete garbage app.",3
This has been the most frustrating experience that I have encountered while setting up my new authority and trucking company. I went with trucker path for my ELD. It has not worked since day 1. And I have had no support from their supposedly 24 hour customer service. I don't even know how the device works she had because I can't get it activated. I am completely and thoroughly disappointed with trucker path,4
Used to be an awesome apphowever is now just about every feature that it had that made it a great app has gone to a paid service making it basically useless,4
I have used this for years. I plan myroutes and love that It would route me on truck routes. Now I see I have to purchase the membership to get access to the truck routes. Well if I cant use this for a semi then it's No Help To Me and My LLC. So we will look for another App to help us.,4
it has its ups and downs but I like it right now cuz it picks up all the places so far thank you truckers path,0
Previous version better. Don't like the new routing. I can't use turn by turn directions. Im stuck in a loop.,0
Change it to what it was before the update,0
Was good now you want to charge and know my personal information,0
I don't get this app.. I am a city driver 48' dry van P&D I pay for this app and it turns a 8 min drive into a 22 min drive. There are entrances into industrial parks that are specifically for trucks and instead it will try to take me to the no truck entrance on the opposite end of the industrial park. It takes me down roads in the city that are no truck lanes. Going to businesses like kohl's or Walmart it takes me to passenger car entrances How have I arrived on the side of the highway???????,3
"Not good, trying to find out if the southbound weigh scale on I-43 is opened or not. Gives me parking places instead of what I need to know.",0
"Previous version please? Ya'll messed it up again. Disallows routing through google maps. You're trying to force us into memberships, data collection and potential spamming and sales of our data. Sell ads, not our data.",1
Too many updates,0
"WILL NOT let me cancel the dumb subscription that I accidentally let run over the free trial by one day. Out of months of having this app, it has came in handy ONCE.",4
Too many fdeeze ups. It sucks,0
Used to like this app but now they want to charge 99.99 per year to get routes optimized for a truck. It's an app for truckers used to be free. Am going to uninstall no longer useful,0
"I find that Trucker Path has turned into a money hungry bunch, I find there ways being dishonest. You buy a subscription then they change things and charge more and remove itwms you had for your current subscription, They want to force you into the next level. They are as far as I am concerned a corrupt bunch and I think it is time for the BBB to look into there actions. What a sad thing, started out as a good tool for the trucking industry then they go and get greedy. They dont refund",4
Ok use to love this app but now you are no longer a trucker friendly app you cater to the cars. And make trucks pay for the correct info.,4
The recent updates have ruined this app in pretty much every aspect. Edit to add... you cant give a text update for places without joining their email and info selling club. Sorry drivers Id love to help inform y'all but im not letting these people have my info to make money off of the information we provide to them for free.,0
The app did tell me the best truck route. Now it wants me to become a member to give truck route. Now it just gives best car route for free. Have used app for years but thinking of finding another unless it starts give truck route again,4
Poor,0
"Since It's been updated to a social media website I haven't been able to find the basic things that truckers are looking for. Like scales, parking, fuel, etc. Just keep it Simple. I have enough social media pages. What happened to my buttons?",0
"Used to be a great app. Now you have to give them all sorts of personal information and create a ""profile"" to even leave a review.",4
IT STINKS!!,0
"Wow now you have a trick to get my email or phone number or Facebook! (I don't want a free trial!) Uninstall this isn't the only truck app, besides I'm not allowed to touch my phone while driving anyway. POINT IS YOU DO NOT NEED MY EMAIL OR FB LOGIN",0
Horrible. Not user friendly at all. Wants you to sign in.,0
BAD,0
Indespensible app if your ort and you run short on hours......very helpful...update 12/2019 app is garbage...its a money grab....hiding stuff unless you pay,0
Can not navigTe,0
Can not locate Ontario canada address. Not very helpful,0
I can't get this to download!,0
The new update 11/21/19 is slowing my phone down and making it heat up. I'm manually having to clear the apps cache multiple times a day. This is getting ridiculous.,1
Not to good,0
Awful customer service,0
"Missing streets, it will take you to streets you dont want to be and that you're not legal to be. Also a blue dot when u just using the map, come on, if the road is blue, why the dot for your location is also the same blue, you driving and you can't find the damn blue dot. is blended with the blue road, I cant believe this app. Also I hate when I'm using the gps to block my screen asking me about truck stop updates. That's a distraction, I have to go to where my tablet is to click not now.🤬",0
GPS system needs an update wayoff on the address,0
Not liking the update. Also not filling out a compulsory survey just to look at the map.,0
When I open this app. Its starting finding a nearby truck stop. I am already on truck stop. I dont need it. Extrimly slow this app.,2
Waste,0
"This GPS is the worse ever, almost got me a ticket in San Francisco",0
The navigation has optimization for trucks. yet it has routed me onto non truck routs.,0
"Dont update this app, turn auto update off. Each update is taking away previously free features and locking them behind a pay wall, adding more and more advertisements as well. Can't wait until a better option comes around.",3
I enjoyed using the app it was very useful. Unfortunately I had to uninstall it. It seemed to hang up while loading. At that point it would simply take over all of the phones. David use the system menu to force close the app. one I would try to reopen it the same thing would happen again.,1
The app was very good but I payed for a month to try it out and only got 2 weeks worth so I am not very happy at this point and don't know who to contact!,2
Good app to have,3
Constantly crashes when you get a phone call message or go to another another app I had paid version.,0
Doesn't work Job function is broken. Kept capitalizing first letter of email telling me not valid.,0
"BE VERY CAREFUL about buying this product! Trying to cancel and still getting billed. I drive a 40 ft. RV and this app doesn't do what I want. They assured me that the ""pro"" version would work for RVs, so I signed up on a month-to-month basis. I have called them several times to cancel and each time they apologize and tell me it's taken care of, but they continue to bill me every month.",3
It was a much better app even when it was free I upgraded to premium definitely don't like does not let you pick what you want to do it used to be a really good app now it is not good at all,3
Cheesy gps lags alot dont know when to take a exit without 2nd guessing and 2 week free trial should have a money back or cancel statment on it. 5 stars to it guiding you to truck gas stations 0 stars for cheesy gps and the layout.,2
App is useless without truckers input and now you have to pay for it.,2
"They got rid of the silver membership. Instead of $17.99 annually, you now have to pay $99 annually if you want the same benefits. Per support, they did this so they can offer an option of an even more expensive subscription in the future. They do not honor your remaining subscription, they just cancel it. Dick move, trucker path. ***Replying to developer's response.*** My issue was that it went from $18 to $99 per year, and your answer to that is: Why not $120 per year, but in installments?",4
I cant get anything to work,0
Updated now it won't open.done it again,0
Have a hard time get it to route me.,0
You cant cancel the service and zero support .,0
"Starting to hate this da** app, having to restart and taking a fu**ing long time to load",0
The weigh stations still all show Green instead of red when they are open. Also it takes a long time for the weigh stations to show up when you open the app. The updates have ruined it. Please fix it and put it back the way it was. Thank you.,4
It doesn't give me any better routing then Google maps it doesn't give me truck routing gives routing for a car,1
No very good. Needs lots of work. Not even almost good. I can get apps FREE THAT ARE MUCH BETTER,0
"Newest update killed this app. is was great when it first started, then was just okay, next update made it bad, and then worse. Newest update has made this app useless. No locations show up on the map, it is just blank.",2
Horrible,0
This app is not optimized for this device. I'm using Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.4. This device not that old at all. I don't know what is going wrong here.,2
"Was a great app... now you have to pay to show current parking updates? And the adds fill up the whole screen randomly. We are already getting gouged at the truck stops, I'll go back to my $4 book thanks",2
I think everyone that paid for the silver membership when they first started charging should file a class action lawsuit. They still take my money but I still see the ads now that they are advertising the same package as gold at 9.99 a month.,0
It's always searching for truck stop for hours waisting my battery to no effect it once upon a time was awesome please fix,0
Used to be a good app. Cant figure out how to use it now. DELETE,3
No longer getting what I paid for with silver (prediction parking) . No use for GPS. No use for ads. What gives. Never mind. Cancelling my subscription. I'm done and I'll find a different way to do this. Quit being so greedy,0
"The hell is truckerpath silver even for anymore? I'm still paying for it and I have adds and none of my features, the hell is going on?!? Why charge for a paid membership and still show ads!?",0
Misrepresentation of paid features. Paid 19.99 and I still get ads. Only benefit you used to get with 19.99 paid is parking prediction but they took that away half way into my paid year. Better off with GPS nav unit and truck stop apps that tell you current parking. Not accurate on the parking/not enough people give reports. Save your money. I want refund for the promise of O ads and fact they take away features that prompted my purchase to begin with. Support sucks. Waste of $$$,0
It was a great app until you had to pay for using the features you before didn't have to pay for. Will switch truck stop apps. Was a silver tier member,0
"I never expected that it can be happened. I bought silver membership for a year for $17, only because I need to use night mode. My silver status activ till April 2020. But they took night mode out, and now asking around $100…!!! So greedy for money! Never pay again!",0
Update! Paid membership has gone from bad to worse. Lowering rating to 1 star. Thanks for the ads on my paid subscription that doesn't end for 6 months. Currently paying for a subscription without receiving the subscription benefits. Don't subscribe until they fix whatever bug they added into their last update.,0
No way guys. Naw as a silver member being for almost a year you take mine night color away for a good membership????? Are you serious???? Why??? That's the only option I wanted and I took the silver membership. That's rude dudes. I won't take any next year.,0
"After using TP for years, they've moved a key feature, night mode, I loved behind a higher paywall without notice. I've already had the annual subscription for the older plan on renew but I don't believe I have a use for it. Rather crack the app for just night mode as I don't have a need for the routing.",2
Takes for ever to load after update,0
It is not user friendly and dont show all truck stop,0
after update bloated advert pig uninstall never buy,0
Hard time working app,0
Trucker path in a word SUCKS!!,4
"Sure was nice when the scale icon changed color for open or closed. I'm not supposed to touch my cellphone as a professional driver but, it's the only way to know if it's open before you cross the scale. So within those parameters, the app is useless.",2
It is a great app but don't ever let them get your telephone number they will continue to call even when you request them to stop,3
Updates ruined this app all it says is finding truck stop near u never shows anything,0
Ok here is the thing SEMI TRUCKS CAN NOT take the Parkways in New York DO NOT FOLLOW THE TRUCKER GPS !!!!,0
At one time I love this app. Seams with every update it gets a little worse. Now it won't let me use the trip planner,4
Used to be a great app. But all the adds and stupid features ruined it.its almost useless now.. can't route trips anymore and too many add one.what a shame.,4
Do not buy this software I purchased a year subscription on the silver plan then upgraded to gold monthly then cancelled gold plan. They canceled silver as well. They will not turn my subscription back on. They said I would need a receipt to prove I paid on a plan they have been servicing for 6 months now. Their CS representatives made me feel like a criminal that was being perp walked on a service that I already paid for. REPLY: Do not waste my time if you do not want to correct the situation.,1
Greed has killed this app. Nearly everything is now paywalled and every screen change brings about a fullscreen ad. Borderline unusable at this point.,0
route planning not working at all since the update. Samsung Note 9.,0
I can't believe you are now charging for this app. You have ads and we do the work by putting in status updates VERY DISAPPOINTED,2
"I wish i could write reviews after each update because you guys keep getting worse and worse. Truck drivers use this app, not computer engineers, all we ask for is a simple app where we can find the best route for us, look for truck stops and weight stations, in as little taps as possible because we dont have the time to write down a complete ""code"" just to look for truck stop.",2
It sucks now because you have to pay for updates,0
Now they want you to pay for everything it use to be a great app DON'T UPDATE USE OLDER VERSION MUCH BETTER now they are just getting greedy,3
"I really need to stop updating this app, each new version is more terrible than previous.",1
Doesn't factor height in the route. I entered all my dimensions and the APP still routed me on roads that I do not have the clearance for. Could have turned out really ugly.,0
I was just trying to give my brother truckers a place to park. I went through all the things i had to answer. I gave the places address but it kept on not letting me.,0
The new update doesn't allow you to trip plan I'm sitting in apoka fl but the app shows me in ft Myers I've tried everything from restarting my phone to turning my location on and off but it still wont update,1
"First hour of using it, and quitting on me three times, already, on the road. Perfect, it cannot get any better, in the middle of traffic, changing lanes, and merging highways. This app is useless, and you find yourself screaming which way am I my going.",2
"**I have a paid Silver membership, & they're still putting obnoxious & distracting spam ads on the app. Plus other distracting nonsense that's trying 2 get me 2 disclose more personal info, which I don't need 4 them 2 have. Plus they're always obnoxiously pushing the pointless Gold membership on me in various distracting & annoying ways. I've tried the Gold, & didn't like it, but they keep pushing it @ me. (Resp 2 Dev->) Are u incapable of comprehension? ALL ads are unacceptable 4 a PAID app!!",2
It keeps crashing,0
this was the greatest app ever until this most recent update they add advertisements! Now it is by far the shittiest app I have ever had that went from the greatest application that any and all truckers would use for the benefit of any and all truckers and then somebody had to get greedy. Some of us actually paid for the memberships when we first got it to help the developers and then cancel them after a while since we didn't really need them. And what do they do at advertisements!!!...,2
"Had it for years.. now you have to pay for any real time update, parking and weigh stations.. so long trucker path... Uninstalled",4
I drop it to one star and might uninstall the app just becuse i like other truck drivers report if there is parking were i am at. But now i report amd someone else is going to pay for my parking report then it is not worth me reporting to this app anymore.,0
"Trucker Path doesn't know what I-80 is! It routed me on several occasions hours out of route. Even when I'm on I-80 and put in a new route going elsewhere where 80 is the only sensible route, it takes me off it. Sent email to support, and they said they're ""adding features all the time."" Being aware of I-80 is a feature? Now they added advertisements on the screen. Nope, bye. Uninstall.",4
Damn app is down again...I pay for a subscription for a service that only works part time,0
"Got bought by a Chinese company, now it's all spam",0
"Since the update, app is now garbage. The in app ads for slot machines etc have ruined a great app. Being unable to set up routing and having it crash every time is a problem. The potential places to pick up a load don't help either it just clutters the map when trying to find a safe haven. In attempts to make people pay for your product you fail to realize the majority of drivers are company drivers who do not get to write off the monies spent on the app and load info is not helpful. Deleting.",2
Why not timestamps for comments?,0
Latest update will crash Everytime I try and put a route in. Will change rating once fixed,3
Do not working after Last update. Honor 8x,0
Crashes Everytime I try to route plan I put in a destination and routing crashes. uninstalled and reinstalled still the same result. Moto z3,0
"Used to be good, not anymore. After a recent update a few weeks ago I found my phone very sluggish, battery draining and data useage high along with random pop up ads using chrome when I was not even using a browser. I tried all sorts of virus scanners. Finally used os scanner and it found a dozen internet connections for Trucker Path even when the app had not been open, even after reboot. Deleted Trucker Path and WOW my phone is back to normal. So did the devs sell out to ad companys? Yes!",4
It was best trucker app for everything now it's garbage,0
"This app used to be amazing when I downloaded it a few years back. But, the more they updated it, the worse it became. Now, the app barely functions at all. Glitches constantly, causes my phone's screen to go black, and then my phone freezes and then i have to restart it. I've deleted this app. I may consider downloading it again if the developer would fix the bugs, or make the app the way it was originally.",3
"Installed the app on my phone and tried routing to my destination, at first it routed me down I80 as it should. I then installed it on my tablet so I can use it as my dedicated GPS, once I signed in and tried to rout to the same destination the stupid app decided my only available route was down through Denver than back up to Kenosha wi from Laramie Wy adding double the time to get to my destination. I tried everything I could to get it to route down 80 but it refused. UNINSTALLED!",0
"The app has been crashing on me nonstop midway through my subscription, Ive uninstalled, reinstalled, cleaned storage, cache, used sd maiden, rebooted, etc. This is crashing as soon as I plan a truck route. And if the issue isnfixed will I get credit for the unused service?",4
Difficult to use.,0
App is not working,0
"Update 09/26/19. After today's update,app became totally unusable..When you try to put route,app crashes,and shuts down totally..Must have app for a truck driver! Used to be great,now so bad,almost unusable,please fix it.These updates made this app so hard to use..",2
Way to slow,0
"So your latest update has turned the app into a paid subscription. Cant get current status or trending status of weigh station unless you pay for a monthly or yearly subscription. Yet you still want us to give you the status updates on them, sorry I dont deal in one way arrangements, I'll find a better offer",2
App keeps closing since update,3
After update no longer works,0
Was perfect until update. Wont route my trips. Screen cuts out.,0
"The changes that were made are causing the application not to work. They want you to made a profile now, to paid for truck routing lol We can just used a map to do that. I need a application that works this application shuts off when trying to build a route.",0
"The app worked excellent in the past, just downloaded an update and now Everytime I try to get directions the app force closes and restarts",0
Always glitched!!!!!!,0
App crashed and now crashes upon trying to re-route. Left me totally stranded.,0
"Since the update yesterday, the app crashes everytime I try to set the route for our drive.",0
Since the update as soon as i put in address the app closes. Im paying for this app too. And i cant even use it. Smh. Ripping me off,1
"App is useless, crashes constantly and with the latest update you can't even open navigation without it crashing. I've unsubscribed and have zero intentions of using this app again, nor would I recommend it. I'll take my chances with Google maps and a road atlas.",1
"This a truck app, not a passenger car app. Once it tried to put me on a NY parkway and in VT it tried to take me off a truck route that clearly said ""Trucks follow Rt 2 to go east""!",4
Can't wait till subscription runs out,0
"Trah app. I bought the member ship and now i want to desactivate, but it s impossible! I asking it s liegal?",0

Needs a real update. Bought hold membership before dont think I'll do it again...if you have no service app is useless especially out in the middle of nowhere,2
How do I end my subscription??,0
After the most recent update the app wouldn't show the location of any truckstops I've deleted an redownloaded the app twice now,2
I can no longer use that route option thing,0
Pay for commerical routes DELETE!,0
Michigan DOT stays logged in to this App and falsely updates scales as closed continuously. Rendering one of the most useful features of this app useless!,2
POS can't even find Warren Ohio....,0
The old version was good but now working very slowly and tough to use,0
Horrible I,0
How I can unsubscribe???,0
App keeps taking all the POI away and only way to temporarily fix it is to delete and reinstall and I shouldn't have to do that every time I wanna use it,3
Can't get poi any more,0
Use to be a good app. Now it's trash.,3
For some reason I can't see anything anymore. I tried to reinstall it but it doesn't work the map is blank and nothing works,0
Sucks now. Doesn't work like it used to. Moving on,0
This app was great but over the years has been getting worse. Now it is useless . Can't update scales and always showing scales open.,0
Horrible took me through the wrong way in Michigan and it keep freezing on me and I really need it right now I want my money back this app is horrible,0
"I have the gold membership and it doesn't expire for another 8 months.. I am getting adds on the app and it will not navigate anymore, can I get some help?",0
Just updated this app and now it doesnt show any truck stoos or rest areas.... Junk!!!,3
"The Points of Interest (truck stop locations, weigh stations) are not working. Read other reviews where this has been happening to other users. Still is not fixed. I love this app when it actually works, but since its not working, will not be using it until it is fixed.",4
Now they want to charge to use it.,0
"I've used this app for about 3 yrs now, used to love it. Now it's not pulling up any points of interest, change it back to how it was before the last update.",0
"Was great,used for years,now you have to pay",0
"I downloaded a new update and now it's not showing any truck stops, weigh Stations, rest areas, ETC on the map.",4
"Was pretty good before the latest update, though the ads had started to get obtrusive. Now it's worthless because POIs (truck stops, weigh stations, etc) won't load. That's on all three of my phones... S10+, S9+, G6. I'm looking for an alternative where the developers actually test software before releasing it the unsuspecting general public.",3
It doesnt show places,0
Remove TRYING TO FIND A STRUCK STOP NEAR YOU..if service not good it keep trying to download,0
"Updated and now it shows nothing. No scales, parking, fuel. Uninstalled and re installed. Now it works.",0
This used to be a great app. But they changed it because they want money. I uninstalled it it is that bad. These brilliant technology people actually are stupid. They create a great app that is friendly and works well but they have to change it and then it sucks. Evidently they have to change it to keep their damn job. This is really upsetting because this app was awesome in the beginning. I say skip it and don't use it.,4
Updated and now none of the POI are showing up,0
Was fine until they..did the update,0
"It was cool when it worked. After the update, it don't show anything. I used this app even when I'm in my car... NOW ITS WORTHLESS... anyone know an app o can use in replace of TRUCKER PATH?",0
"Great app at first! I was a paid subscriber but I needed to cancel my subscription. As soon as I did it is no longer working. Shows no truck stops, weigh stations or anything now! Went from 5 star to 1 star. Guess unless you pay for it now it won't work for you.",4
It stopped working no stops of any kind I uninstalled it,0

keepa crashing with new update,1
I updated and it stop working. Everytime the app updates something gets ruined. The old version from 2017 was the best.,0
Trucker path has been going downhill for a while without any breaks I think we all know that. If you guys need another app to use I recommend the app Truck parking USA.seems a little rough around the edges but from what I can tell that I can get what I need out of it at least,1
"Everything is gone! No more parking, truck stops, ws, nothing! The last update wiped everything... They must have jumped on the fmcsa screw truckers train!",2
good app but i don't like last version. Version befor update was better. Because.... when i try to look around by moving circle with finger after a while circle is going back to my location. Again this app have issues.,3
how do i get rid of favoride places were i didnt put a star on at all,0
Garbage. Too many problems to list here. Do not install!,0
Tried to enter garden city Georgia but app wouldn't pull it up.,0

It used to be great,3
"Just downloaded this app for truck navigation and decided to give a try.. it took me via the city through the bridge 12.8... when i downloaded this app i specified that my truck height is 13.6, so, I'm assuming this is not a real truck navigation app... i had so much stress to get out of that place.. TRUCKERS, DON'T USE THIS APP, or you will be stuck somewhere and wont be able to get out... and i have screenshots of the places where it was taking me, i can send to customer service any time.",0
When I go to a different app and I go back to trucker path it goes. Blackout and I got a I have to uninstall it and reinstall it to get it back onto my screen,4
"Very disappointed, can't use the app if you don't join in, no thanks!",3
Very nice.,0
Why do we have to pay a membership to route trips,0
App used to work great. Now with all the updates it is totally worthless thanks Trucker Path Wouldn't recommend this app to anyone!!!!!!!!!☠☠☠☠,3
It was fine until it sent me down back roads in kentucky where trucks are not suppose to be. Turns so tights my trailer was almost all the way off the road. I had the optimized routing on and it tried to send me down a road that had a no truck sign!,0
This app is now useless it automatically closes when you open it,2
"Used to be free to get routes, now u have to pay!",0
I've got Gold membership and can't even get trucker path downloaded on my phone. what the hell!!!!! I called that number and they told me to call Google. How the hell do I do tha????.,4
Used to work great but now all I get is ads to buy the premium version and a screen attempting to search for nearby truck stops. Completely unusable. Glad I didn't waste money on this app.,2
Used to be a good app.,3
They are scam ...beware of them ..and on top of that how are they legal..no cancel membership button but yeah the have a button for upgrades..am not a truck driver and i know why they stealing my money ...don't sign up...,2

Never shows half the truck stops around and the address search never returns any results. Waste of time.,1
"app has been looking for a truck stop for an hour and I'm two miles away from one, clearly the app doesn't work",0
sucks,0
App getting worse and worse after each and every update. The app opens with a fault message and crashes. Also if you close the app momentarily or choose an option that redirects you to Google maps and try to come back to this app it crashes. Then you have to force close and restart the app again. Pain....,3
my anti-spyware said this app was recording my voice calls also it's restarts my phone,0
Address not found. I type in my farm address and this app can not find the street. useless.,0

Your app is screwing up despite updating it and it is not responding. Fix the bugs please,0
i tried 5 times to install but it work instal because says file is 90.34 and it downloads 93.68,0
I don't like the new update that has happened to Truckers path. I don't care for the extra small words or numbers should I say when your trying to see how far a destanation is from your location... Or when you try and look fartherel down the road how it always forces the app back the the location you at at that moment.. I would like to have the option of going back to the older version. Or Im booting the app and Ill just get a new truck stop book.. Sad because the older Truckers Path was so much.,1
since last update trip planning not working it just continues to load but nothing happens,0
trash app,0
go bk to the way it was it's slow p.s trucks aren't to be on any interstates in around atlanta we have to use 285 e or w if I would have taken you routing it would have costed me 1500.00 fine no big trucks are allowed in Atlanta,0

"signed up with two separate emails, when I try to log in it tells me that the email has not been taken, then when I try to sign up it tells me that the email has been taken. this is true for both email addresses.It won't let me log in with my phone number either, it tells me to try again later.",4
lots of unnecessary stop on the map that fill up the map and can't get rid of it,0
"Thank you for simplifying the parking report, update 5/17/19 I paid the 4.99 for the optimization of the app originally then y'all take it away. now you want 9.99 for it or a year and app won't let me use map unless I pay. I guess is your app and you do what you please with it. but you lost me as a subscriber. cancelling subscription before next billing cycle if use of map without optimization is fixed. one star for screwing us out of money. update 7/31/19 there is no confusion, y'all chngd deal",4
you have to pay to use anything in this app. it may be Beneficial for owner operators,2
New update 7-29 makes you sign up for even basic features that were free before.,1
"Honestly I liked the older version. I understand you have to pay the bills but the pop ups that you can't bypass are annoying as f***! map screen drifts as you try to tap on stops and the stops are so stacked on top each other you can't differentiate... also annoying as f***! If I pull up the app it's because I need it, I don't want to take a mandatory survey while driving down the road before I can see if the scale 2 miles away is open.. App has become more trouble than help..",4
Used to be a decent app. The last few updates have rendered it almost useless. Way to go! Over engineer a useful product until you have a waste of storage space.,0
putting a bad taste in my mouth already. what in the world does my trailer license plate have to do with getting from point A to point B?,0
don t use it like a gps it gonna take you prohibited route i just waste my money,0
too many ads and pop ups,4
the worse waste of time that you could ever find,1
"First it wants access to my phone. Then, you have to log in. Was simpler and better before it was ""improved."" Looking for a replacement.",0
100$ just to see if it is right for you.,0
n.,0
this app makes you put in info then will not open so you can use it,0
no map service ☹️,0
"customer service is pathetic, worst app ever, doesnt even do a adress to address route, only city to city which is not useful!",0
"keep saying error can use if error comes out..""can't not initialize map at this time""",0
dose not work,0
Installed this app today to help navigate around Chicago and it was trying to direct me to roads that semis are NOT allowed.,0
Doesn't work,0
new update shows no map!!! how can we find places with no map? this bug needs corrected yesterday! even uninstalled and reinstalled...same issue,1
bought the app because a friend suggested it. wanted a good truck gps so i bought the premium. first trip i wanted to go to Mexico beach and end up in the middle of Panama. only good if your looking for a truck stop,2
bad,0
requires paid subscription to optimize navigation for commercial vehicles. They only tell you that after you create an account.,0
"Worked fine for like a day and a half, then started asking me to take a damn quiz and disabled the back button; uninstalled",0
Not useful can't add via points in routing. Support acts like they don't have a clue to what they are doing. Always call don't email they will never return email,0
"this app was fine until it was updated. NOW IT SUCKS!!!! you can hardly navigate it now for all of the pop ups. you have to enter all kinds of info about your truck and then, after you do that, the pop ups never stop. its shouldnt take going through all that just to pull up a route. this used to be a good app but now, im just looking to replace it. just too much to have to type in and go through and then, just when you think you might be done giving all the information required, here come the ad",4
"doesn't respond, tricks you out of 99",0
I'm canceling because of the failure of the map I received a tiket,0
need exit number not exit name please. just like it used to be. than you.,0
"it't not free anymore, before that it help a little bit, but now no one pay for it",0
I am disappointed because I cannot select and update places are open or closed for scales.,0
no directions,0
Fkng update...,0
It suck after up date keep asking same question & wants to upgrade. I remove the apps done with BS. one import note KISS.,0
USELESS if your going to Quebec!,0
screwed up right now you can't even get up figure out where out and put a route in cuz they want that money,0
10 minute load times simce the addition of paid app ads.....wont let you search twice without clising app and starting over with the same ads again. as for me id never pay $99 a year for another trucker to tell me if there is space at a truck stop. i can get that info for free on the CB!!!!!! Your app has gone down hill so bad it has become unusable,0
Doesnt give you accurate route,0
"I remember when this app was free. Now we have to pay for crappy services, slow loading, unnecessary upgrades, and have to answer a thousand questions. Sorry guys, but Trucker's Path is ruined. Uninstalling the app.",0
It just wouldn't work for me. No matter where I was it thought I was in Iowa and wouldn't let me turn on location.,0
used to love no its a pain in the ass and i dont want any damn offers about jobs or fuel cards im a company driver and love the place i work,0
sucks,0

"New design is extremely slow and glitching, especially after the last udates. I got the same issues as other drivers. Optimize Routing For Trucks is just wasting of phone memory. Neither Garmin nor Rand McNally doesn't know how to route semis correctly. The App used to be great, but now it almost impossible to use.",3
"I was driving a moving truck off of long island and NYC rules say I cant drive on parkways. I downloaded this app just to choose to avoid parkways, and every route it gives me tells me to take a parkway. useless",0
ever since the last update all I get is a white screen !! can you send me a link to a previous one ?? is a very helpful app.. but it's not to helpful right now !,0
"you suck big donkey cock this app doesn't do what its suppose to do.14 wide and 14'8"" high go straight up the interstate like hell.",3
Do not get the gold membership. The turn by turn does not work.,0
"Trucker Path app can't even find a route from Oklahoma City to Compton,California! worthless!! And from Strafford, Mo it said it was 7 hours to Oklahoma City! By what route?? Timbukto????",4
it sucks to use now,0
"had to delete it. gave it a good rating back in the day. I hear it's now owned by a Chinese company. Still worked fine, up until the last update. then it started wanting information it didn't need and wouldn't let me skip over it. so I said NOPE, and deleted it. went ahead and downloaded the primary truck stop apps instead. Pilot and Loves, since those 2 are really the only ones I go to.",0
"When I open the app, I expect the app to display. Instead, I randomly get fullscreen ads with the close button hidden in a corner and most recently, a quiz you cant skip before you can actually use this user unfriendly app.",2
"Turn on route optimization...yeah I had all of the correct information entered and had it turned on. You probably have the ability to look at my profile and see it all entered there...Just admit you've reskinned Google Maps and are charging +$100 a year for the privilege of the frustration. Then after you've swallowed that pill, try taking mine and other's concerns seriously instead of indirectly suggesting we're idiots.",1
"Ruined! Do not buy upgrades. This app is so cumbersome AND glitchy trying to get it to work it is going to cause a terrible accident. Additionally, you can no longer see traffic issues on it which was a good combination with truck stop and weigh station info. I never update things anymore. Fuel prices were never correct. Pilot always the lowest when not correct? Hmm. Lost its usefulness in March/April 2019. Used to love it and run it continuously. Now it uses too much data as well. RIP Old TP. :(",4
this is a trucking industry app. Who cares what kind of driver you are company owner operator broker who cares. Why do you need to know how I want to use the app can't you find that out through app statistics. no reason to answer a whole bunch of questions just to use the app. and I use it rarely now it will be uninstalled never to be used again. REPLY TO DEVELOPERS RESPONSE: it is not a matter of knowing how to register. Any idiot can do that. No one should be forced to register to use an app.,2
update is junk doesnt load maps saids unknown problem and they keep trying to get you to pay for it ...was great now pure junk and useless,0
"You guys have really screwed this app up. It was good now it's nothing but lag and errors. It wasn't broke, why the UI overhaul? It was perfectly fine.",0
"This USE to be a great app! So good I had my daughter and mother put it on their phones for when they traveled. With the last update I started having problems with the maps part loading. So I purchased the Gold version....NOW the app loads and opens but spins when you put in an address, FINALLY it will say UNKNOWN ERROR and continue spinning for ALL ETERNITY!!! Uninstalled. Reinstalled. NOTHING!!! Forget the Gold, I want my $ back!! I have an Android Note 9.",4
Maps won't load I'm tired of the gold membership advertisement every time I open the app. also a lot of the stops are outdated,2
not working on android,0
"not worth paying for! this is the most unreliable, glitchy app that i have ever used! they continue to update it, adding MORE glitches and NEVER fixing the current ones. want to keep the same route? doesnt mattet if u choose yes, takes u back to enter info over again. All the parking lots have grey stripes thru them and if u zoom in on something it adds a location pointer that u cannot erase, u have to start the app over. i dont have time for this!",3
used to be fine but now it crashes all the time,0
"I use to use this app for finding truckstops. After a recent update, I'm now forced to answer questions about my usage before allowing me back into the app. I wish not to answer these questions. Since there's no way to skip these, the app is now 100% useless and broken to me.",2
Not only buggy but I signed up for the gold on the monthly plan to see if things would get better and to try the gps routing. The route program keep crashing. Areas marked for truck parking only had car parking and instead of the monthly membership they charged me 99.99 for a full year. What the hell T.P.?,0
whats up with this app today? got it on 2 devices( one is new lg g8 phone) and its not working propertly. tablet just exits the app once i press route. now 8 hrs later I see its not only me. this app became total disaster with new update. good job,1
it use to be good now it sux. Every update worse and worse. parking Symbol 9 times out of 10 it shouldnt be there because there's no parking. They screwed the whole restaurant tab up. its always missing restaurants.,0
Just purchased trucker path gold used it twice gps off by couple miles uninstalling,4
uninstalled! will not navigate or plan a route unless you open an email account with them and supply licensing info.,0
has. become to intrusive deleted it off phone,0
I was using the app and once I got to the middle of Hoboken New Jersey it completely crapped itself. I saw a complaint about in heavy populated areas it doesn't do well and I can see it's a thing.,1
would give it a 5 star but last update starts me in Berlin and roads have red on them so I cant tell if the road is a 4 lane or 2 lane..why mess up a great app with stupid updates. I have uninstalled and reinstalled n getting tired of trying to fix something thats broken. As for truck stops..2 tags n one is blank.. it should be easy to update one with all the feed backs..sad..use to be a good app. No new updates so still the same. Funny how my post didnt get a responce on original post in March.,3
they are constantly changing this app and now I can't use it to find out miles to go delivery you guys want information I have nothing to do for the reason I use this app I'm literally at that point to uninstall this app,1
This app is not working anymore. Don't install. Just a white screen.,0
horrible experience!!! don't pay them for gold membership GPS NOT WORKS!!! I have note 9 (it is very powerful phone) and it stuck.No option to choose avoid tolls road a lot of mistakes! Peoples who build this app NEVER DRIVE A TRUCK and complitle dont understand for who they make a product! Also they charge 99dollars you can't choose month by month payment!! and never give money back!!! And I try log book as well 2 month and Iam done. You solution not working I can see the order only in my app!,0
Can I download a version of this app from 2016 when it was good?,0
"Used this app for years. Liked it. All of a sudden, after last mandatory and unvoluntary update, it stoped working. I uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it back, ... and there it goes: ""Your device is not compatible with this version ...""?!?! And it was. For years, ... up to an hour ago? WHY? I have android 4.2.2. phone which I do not plan to throw away just to run your app. Busting well working things. Too much time on idle programmers hands, I guess?",1
unable to contribute toward weigh station status with my android. everytime i open the app it starts out in Indiana i have the whole account setup and it still cant figure out where the hell i am,2
have used this app with you guys since day 1....downloaded on many phones always worked great... went to tmobile 2 weeks ago got a stylo4 and your app will download and shows all features but the map wont load.....have tried so many times but still wont work ...map wont load at all.....had it on my stylo4 from metro and it works ok ....and still does on wifi on my metro stylo but not on tmobile stylo....plz help,0
"virtually worthless off the interstate. I pass dozens of truck stops on state hwys everywhere I have to cut between Interstates. These missed stops are always well established, rarely are they brand new but 1 in 20 are.",2
This app used to be my go to for planning stops along a route but I ain't paying 100 bucks a year for some app that used to be free,3
hangagain and again not shown adress once we add i think trucker path need money now,4
it sucks,0
doest work anymore,0
Garbage. navigation never works!!,0
"i used to love this app, bit now they want 10 bucks a month to use it.. thats just a bit on the redonculous side. and also with every update its just gotten worse. very disappointed.. added info, my complaint is not with the app itself just the cost when i dont actually use it for GPS. i have only ever used the app to help plan my trips and without it showing possible routes due to not paying monthly it renders the app almost useless unless i physically check each truckstop",4
"honestly i wasnt very inpressed, not very trustworthy, being in a 53 foot trailer in a major city, luckily i ran two gps's and the gps that was free did a better job 25 percent more of the time than trucker path.",4
worked better a year ago before you started overthinking it. weight stations/ fuel/ parking. you don't need the rest. we all have Google,2
"This has got to be the most worthless Routing App Ever. I have tried to use it four times. all four times it has shut off and I mean exits nav and refuses to pull up a map in the middle of a city (as in I 80 in Chicago, ) if I'm trying to find a truck route to somewhere, it says ""not sufficient map data or some such"" you cant set multiple stops on a route, and this morning it worked just well enough to send me down a tree lined residential street, tearing the lights off of my 53' dry van.",4
app will not plan route every time I go in and select the route I want to take it doesn't actually do any kind of navigation so you constantly have to switch back and forth between GPS and this app,0
bad experiences. I tried the trial. Tried to cancel but have been billed twice. Getting the run around about canceling.,0
"Was using this App until the last update. Now all I have is a blank map. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, no change. This last update is broken on my Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime.",1
This app is horrible can not add destination route it's useless,0
"after the last update, it performed worse. With this newest update, it just keeps saying download pending & wont let me use the version i had so now ots completely useless!",4
99.99 a year for navigation why?,0
upgraded and paid for (have the receipt) upgrade to Gold and it does not let me use the navigational tool and the other gold options. I am very disappointed.,0
This used to be the best app. Now it glitches and freezes so often I can no longer use it,0
it will not work,0
why would I pay for your service when you can't even get the free version correct! please don't send me any more advertisements for trying to get me to pay for service cuz I'm not going to do it the free one aggravates me enough you know how much going to aggravate me if I got to pay for sorry service! the only reason why I'm using your app right now cuz I can't find one that actually works yours is at least halfway decent. Your app is not user-friendly at all!! Thax but no thax!😡,1
update killed it,0
"it seems every time they update the app lately, older versions just stop working completely. i use this app as part of my job and it angers me that the developers keep making it worse and worse. i rarely update the app due to all the fact that every time i do there is all sorts of pointless features added and some very useful features removed or altered to be far worse. if i could give this a lower rating i honestly would.",3
use to be a great app. now it freezes upon opening every single time.,4
"was the best app for a truck driver on the market but now they have more advertisements then ever, the app crashes constantly, and now with the newest update you cant even type in a town to see what is actually avalible on your route with out paying for a minimum $10 monthly subscription the developers behind this afternoon better than anyone else in the industry they think because we're truck drivers we have pocket full of money and want to milk us dry 👎👎👎👎",2
this application became annoying advertisement packed trash trying to lure you into buying not worth the money subscription. slow and crushing on older android,0
app gets worse Everytime it's updated .... terrible don't even deserve 1 star,0
if you're on east coast this trucker path sucks,4
"They ruined it with latest changes. It is awkward and frustrating to use plus the satellite view is blurry and worthless for seeing possible issues. Also, it will not allow me to type in the destination address. It literally will not allow me access to the keyboard.",0
this app really sucks I wanted to try the free trial but another works it was better before you all started charging a fee to use the app now it just suck all around and you all suck the money out of my back account I will do the update but if it doesn't work I will never use this app again and I will tell everyone that i know not to use it either,2
"Used to ba a good app, but now each up date it just goes from bad to worse. About ready to dump it and look for a different one.",3
This sucks so bad,0
this app used to be good but now I have to uninstall and reinstall just to put in new routing info,3
I use to love this app but since the last update It keeps giving me error message on the map. I have cleared the cache and uninstalled/then reinstalled 20 times atleast with the same problem. Please go back to the previous version!!!!! You can get the app up & put in your route & initially see your route. When you come back to the app to look at your route it then gives the error!!!!! please fix this,4
"I just tried to use maps and the truck routing will cost you . so , the average jo cant use until they pay $9.99 per month. geesh , talk about false and misleading information",0
"i downloaded the app, put in the address, after I put all the information of my truck and it sent me to the nj parkway. sorry but I don't trust this app. if i take the parkway a disaster gonna happen. i can even kill somebody if i transport heavy equipment in a flatbed. dangerous app.",0
does not work right..!!,0
This has become one of my best tools for trucking! --EDIT--.... was one of my favorite until they stop showing you recent updates when you decline to pay $20 for it.... now it has no useful meaning! i guess the adds isnt enough!,0
"access location had me in Iowa, from Columbus Ohio",0
Terrible !!,0
"the app has a problame when i am in a route and it is giving me direciones whear to go, then the screen turnes black and it returns me to the place whear I give it direciones.",0
"Poorly done. Can't avoid u turns, toll roads, selected roads. Can't zoom out while navigating. only shows about 1/2 mile ahead of you. Can't see fuel stops, weigh stations, etc while in navigation mode. If the app can't find an address it locks up. Don't expect a response from tech support, I've waited 2 weeks so far. Hopefully the bugs (features) will be fixed/implemented sooner or later. Galaxy Tab A $70 and Sygic truck navigation $130 (lifetime) are far cheaper than $100 a year for premium.",4
"Deleted this app. had used it for a couple of years. Now, you guys want a yearly or monthly fee. Way too high for either plan. You have all but eliminated any useful info for the non payees. App is only good with the contributions of the people using it. What are you gonna do when the truckers have had enough and go to another app? No more Trucker Path for me.",3
"you still haven't fixed this update. you obviously don't hear us. Not Trucker friendly! 1)glitchy, freezes & unexpectedly quits. 2) deep blue path is nice, however you can't see the traffic unless zoom all the way to see a sliver of red for traffic. 3) the blue dot(you on the map) literally goes off the screen as you progress on road. 4) UI is clunky. u hv 2 go 2 bottom arrow to get 2 other screen, then hit top L arrow 2 reroute. 5) get a call and then route dissapears. ugh! Sidney:)",0
no free trial unless you give them cc#,4
Now you need an account to leave weigh station reviews which was used by drivers to communicate detailed updates.,2
"Navigation doesn't work. I type in an address and it just stays on, ""calculating route"". Don't really see the point in keeping this app...",0
not impressed,0
We're not give me details on where I was going could not log in to find truck stops,2
"last update was the worst that ive seen. i dont drive by air miles, if i want to see the reviews about a place i would hit the review tab (why do they have to clutter up the main page?) got rid of the mileage scale,",0
this rating for premium truck navigation feature only. congratulations on having the worst truck navigation app ever. wanted to try this out since I already have the app installed and on my first route it tries to take me over a hundred miles out of my way for no reason. I don't understand why you can't adjust navigation on here but it sucks and I won't be using it . the rest of the app still does what it says it does . stick to what you're good at finding truck stops and Walmart,2
used tweo be a great app but now its sharing your info. I know u have to make some money but since I'm a Driver they sell your route info. Not good,4
Need previous versions back please. My husband didn't update. Lucky him. I can't get mine back.,0
the new app suck...love the old one,0
I would have gave it 5 stars if you still used the older version. this new version is horrible.,1
has lots of issues,0
Use to be a great app until the last update and now it sucks. About once a week i have to delete it and download the app again because it stops working. It does it on my other phone also so i know the problem isnt my phone,4
If I wanted to sign up for your app I would. Too bad that you have to be able to update locations. I don't want you tracking me or offering stops to me!,0
they changed the weight station status so now you can't see if they are open 😡,0
hate new update,1
your system has to be one of the most non trucker friendly GPS I ever seen. I started in boise Idaho and was going to council bluffs Iowa. your GPS wanted me to either go 84 to 86 up into Montana and then into south Dakota down into a little but of Nebraska and then into Iowa. or down 84 into Utah and over the 70 across Colorado into Kansas and into iowa... all of those being 1400 miles or more. but the smart route is 84 to 86 then onto the 30 into Wyoming and grab i80 into Iowa at 1230 miles,0
stupid app doesn't do as anything,3
"dislike new update, everything uploads very very very slow. better off as it was",1
was my go to app now im looking for a new one not gunna pay for it have enough ppl after my money,0
"acting up, can't update scales status unless you uninstall and reinstall. not doing it",0
a real example of fixing something which was never broken. now restaurants dont even pop up when you click on restaurant tab,0
"zero stars! i paid for premium deleted the app uploaded new app, updated every thing and it SUCKS! COMPLETELY WASTED MY MONEY! the free version of this app was SOOOOO much better last year! you guys messed up and got greedy, now your app is terrible!",0
"can I reinstall the old updates back?? because the new update are really bad and the new map is complete different and old one, that was more easy to use, I pay for this app, but if keep changing for bad ,I'll change for different one.",3
It sucks.,0
"I sign up for the silver subscription, everything is fine until I lose my phone. I replace my phone, download trucker path and log in and no silver subscription! I call in get busy signal, then forget. finally call in, get a live person who tells me he sees my subscription. tells me I have to update my version, but advises me to uninstall and reinstall newer version, then I open app no silver sub. call back and am told I have to show my receipt! ask for supervisor, he's only one there!",2
this update makes this app do nothing,0
new update is worst and not working well,1
this app has gotten worse and worse I rely on this app heavily I can't even write reviews at all which regular comments actually help people please fix this or I will delete and move on to something way better,0
"Used to use this app but went with SmartTruckRoute2. 100% better and 24/7 support. if you find a mistake on your route, just text them and they'll get back to you in a few minutes and will update their system with the correction within 30 minutes. Amazing GPS with astonishing support.",2
newest update took away features many truckers and travelers enjoyed. have since downloaded a competitor's app. too bad. truckers path was once the top app. this could now change real quick.,0
your new interface that only offers air miles is absolute trash.,0
dont like this new version. want the old one back. how can I get the old one?,1
"update stated distance between truck & poi was corrected to show the right distance. it does show air miles only. we drive trucks not planes or hellis. why when you choose the miles to poi on the extended view you get rerouted to google map. if I want google map i know how to get it. this is a truck gps isn't it?. again i was forced to give 1 star in order to post, this should have -5 stars.",2
does not work anymore,0
"over the course of several months, the performance of this app has crashed faster than a truck with no brakes down a 9% grade. in their attempt to add editions to the interface and additional options, the app has become laggy. they also have disabled the ability for the screen to flip when the ohone is turnes. now, with theie last update, my phone will no longee even run the app. ""please free up storage and restart app"". you mean, free up ram. stop adding garbage to your app. it was working fine",0
"the latest update was supposed to more accurately list distance to a stop. whell now it shows mileage to the truck stop you select in ""air miles"" how is that in any way helpful to a truck driver?",2
Pretty much junk after all the new updates.,0
I had the app for about a year and a few days ago forced me to update. Now it doesn't work. It keeps freezing and showing truck stops in other states. I had to unistall because my phone wouldn't even turn off or respond,0
it used to be faster now it's slow as hell.Now I use new app that came out witch is 10 time faster.,0
esta actualización es más difícil de operar y los gráficos son mas feos,0
"It was used to be a great app, it helped me find cheaper fuel but now they're always removing all the secondary pumps with cheap diesel. It explains why people not reporting weigh station status, they're not using the app anymore. I am using gas buddy for diesel prices and very happy with results.",4
I liked the old app better this on I have to in large the trip plan every time I open it on my trip. this updated app sucks,0
"I am tired of updating it every single freaking day!!!! just updated it again. slow to load, inaccurate fuel prices (10 cents difference). I think I will just find a new app.",4
the last update ruined the app. you can't leave it on a certain location where you're looking to park at the end of the day. it automatically goes back to your current location.,0
worthless since update,0
"this was once a good app, but now distances are shown as ""air miles"". I'm not flying an airplane, I'm driving a truck.",3
app functiona poorly after update. routing is nearly unusable. freezes constantly. please bring back old app!,0
"Dont bother as its not current on parking and you will waste time driving looking for parking when there is non. No Im not paying for service or upgrade to get better accuracy on your app. As from other reviews it does not matter if you pay or not. I will use what I have as it has never failed me, driving for over 25 yrs. never relied on apps to find my parking. I used good ole USA maps.",1
sucks,0
I have had trucker path for the last 2 years awesome app. until now miles shows air miles that's fine and dandy but I'm not flying the truck,4
WAY to many ads. They want $ to remove. Long loading of info. Able to update parking status from 100 miles away! David 201 Yes review below reminded me of the FREEZE when a red pin appears once simply touching the screen. ARRRGG,0
glitchy,0
"its impossible to use after app update, horrible in everything, starting with directions, ending with small fonts.....",2
"every time an update comes out i just expect the app to get worse. it used to work really well, but the second i got duped into paying $99/yr it just went downhill. the routing option just a month ago was perfect but now there are so many errors and crashes i just want to crash down a mountain. just please give us a ui that is simple and WORKS when we need it. you had such a good thing going and it feels like greed or hubris ruined the user experience.",0
never works it joke,0
beginning to.be more trouble than worth . Every time it updates you loose places. When you call it seems you are getting the run around.,0
"does not work after update. 04-15-19 ""unable to find desired rout""",0
junk app ...lagge freezes up....dnt loaf stops junk,0
Updates make app. totally worthless Updated review-- 4/15/19. App. is getting better with updates since last reviewed. Let's hope the latest version gets better. I see some of the reviews have complaints so we'll see. I've used it for several years and seems to work great most of the time although lately seems to take forever to load. 😆😢😆😢😆😢,0
"your app sucks anymore! it use to work great! now it keeps restarting, won't load, slow! going to look for something else!",0
"need to get rid of the search bar and the bottom bar on the map ,this app was perfect 2 updates ago ,why fix if it's not broke",0

been using this app for years but this new update made it where i can't make routes anymore without upgrading to gold status and paying smh......,1
this app sucks! not as simple as the FIRST or better. i never had a problem with the original. this new takes at least 3 trys for it to work. it's always stalls or freezes upon opening the app. the original gets straight to the point.,0
app wont load uninstalling it dont work anymore with all the extra junk in it now,4
the app worked much better before it was sold to out of the USA country company. now I rarely use it. it freezes up not as accurate as it used to be.,0
wont open after latest update,3
4/12/19 just did the update that claimed to fix miles to place nope made it worse now dist on the details page are the same as you get on the pop up first (hint we drive trucks not fly planes) the map on the details page is redundant and just in the way so i now have to scroll to find the pertinent info like how many spots there are to begin with scales ect. The shrinking and lightning of the font for important info like exit #'s has made it harder to see. Overall it's getting worse with every up,0
was excellent until the update . almost worthless now,0

Ive used trucker path for over a year and it has been amazing but the new update that came in a couple of days ago has destroyed my opinion of this app. Its Now unbearably slow to load, borderline unresponsive to screen touches, setting routes from location to location is more convoluted than it was before.

"Gets worse with each update. Unnecessary map on the info tabs. Can't use when rotated now because the ""places"" button disappears. Takes forever to load. Restarts a new session if you click away to another app briefly which causes it to have to totally reload again. Ads, (while fine in theory because capitalism is awesome), are poorly designed like they're an annoyance on purpose so you'll subscribe. Reviews that I've posted often never show up and it harasses you to update parking way too much.",0
this sucks. every route it suggested was a no truck route or no commercial vehicle. I dont recommend.,4

Walmart doesn't show up no more?,0
I'd strongly advised to restore a previous version,0
used to use this app (Trucker Path) all the time.. but since the updates it takes way to long to load and i lose my route if i leave the screen... and WAY to many buttons to push just to route the dam thing....yall need to re-think the setup and think like a driver...,2
I gave this app a 5 star rating when I first got it....now I wish I could give it a -5. the new update is for the birds. I have called support about it 6 times and still can't get any help!!! You're fixing to lose a paying customer!!!!!!!,1
this New version sucks i do not want the new version i want the old version back PLEASE,1

"****UPDATE****: STILL Disappointed. I paid for a subscription. I just updated the app and it still doesn't list parking spots! It says ""Error Happened."" The same error comes up on the weigh station status. Please fix this and I'll change my rating, or I want my money back!",2
the new update is difficult to navigate and the app keeps glitching and kicking me off in the middle of a search,3

you're up Dave sucks big time used to be able to scroll ahead to see if truck stop for full or empty can't do that no more how do you call this an update this is a downgrade,0
"where's our old truckpath, stupid f....ng updates",0
This version is just terrible. It looks more polished but it is a turd. It doesn't work well when Google maps is running. Which you need since it crashes all the time. It will not find routes or addresses. Swiping to see nearby locations will send it careening into another state or country .Why is default location Berlin Germany? I want previous version.,0
i been bitching about this for a month and you still ain't fixed it I'd give it no stars because it ain't worth it,0
your update sucks. more like a downgrade. I use to love this app. now everytime I exit the app. I have to put the zip code all over again. it also keeps saying location cant be found. if you guys can fix this I'll keep the app. I'll be looking for a new trucker app for now.,4
update is trash go back to the old version if its not broke Don't fix it,0
"used to be a good app, now they updated it without me allowing updates, and it's all garbage, it freezes, won't allow searched locations to be routed to workout retyping the address, places location marks randomly, won't let me see what I'm typing when re-entering the dang addresses. guess I'll be looking for a new app also they load an ad almost every time you switch back to their screen from another program.",3
pretty bad for directions hold on one second I'm sorry hello,0
Liked the way the older versions were. You could easily readjust your route and never seemed to have any problems. The newest version is different but been getting kicked off a lot which isn't pleasant in an unfamiliar big city. Plus unless you type in and adress you get kicked over to Google maps which doesn't show low bridge's.,1

"the new update is complete trash! Tried to make it all fancy and nice and it sucks more than ever!!! What a Shame always trying to get money out of some where! can't even post a review with out having to sign up, Its just stupid now.",1
for the past two years its been awesome. now it pisses me off more then anything trying to find an address that you have to type in twice. unless its fixed soon I will not be recommending this thing to anymore drivers. my rating 5 star old version. this new update I give - 100!!!!!!!.,1
complete waste of money half the time it doesn't even pick me up while I'm moving. terrible layout for directions anyway and 7 out of 10 times it tells me route error route couldn't be found I have way better luck using plain Google. I love the idea cuz you can see the truck stops weigh stations and Bridge Heights but it definitely needs some work I wouldn't pay for the service. I would have been super pissed off if I paid the 99 for a year and received what I got,4
The only thing I see good about this app is finding truck stop excreta. As far as truck routes it's ok. The voice command suck. Estimated time of arrival is way off. Your phone has to be on the whole time your driving or it loses the GPS and you can't get it back. I still have 6 days left on my trail and I still use Google maps more due to it's way better designed. I'm not sure who the trucker is that designed this app for truckers but I think he would know better. Read all the reviews first.,1
it sucks too slow,0
after update it doesn't work for me. app closes when i try to route,0
Great app.. however it keeps crashing and crashing. everytime I try to type in an address the app closes. Is there a fix to this? thanks.,3
I paid the $18 a month I never received my premium service. I contacted the developer and have heard nothing. don't go premium.,0
Last update is awful. Can I please get my old version?,0
"APP became TRUCKERS DISTRACTED PATH instead of Trucker path that you should rename or can you put a downgrade link so we can use it like the way it was before the 3/15 update, because now its just useless app, and its not safe anymore because i keep put my destination over and over every time I want to see where im at on the map",4
why do you want all this information now and why did you update my app without permission,3
if you guys can add truck route directions as Google map or Sygic truck map works. i will give it 5 stars and buy the premium happily for sure. There is a routing thing in the app but is this the way map routing is used by the drivers ? there should be a reason to keep this app running on phone screen for 10 hours straight. Truck gps give the route and tells about the weight scale ahead 5 kms in advance. this app should also do that. app is a great idea but poorly executed. sorry,2
Bring back the old version,0
it sucks I wont my money back,0
"updated review... latest update made this useless for me. no longer available in landscape on my tablet, and overall sluggish performance now. went from 5 stars first review to one currently. please fix xxxxxxxxx Great app!

The app will randomly crash, distances are completely inaccurate, the review system for locations will recycle years old reviews and mark them as new, locations of too many stops and even scales are inaccurate and it only functions 25% of the time. I have to open the app 3 to 4 times before it is responsive enough to be usable. Terrible.",3

this app sucks now the changes are flawed I keep trying to find a stop and it keeps recentering on me. this app sucks,0
used to be a good app. since last update you can't move the map to look at stops further up the road. it keeps pulling itself back to your current location,3
was a great app until the auto update. now it just is asking too many permissions. i deleted it and reinstalled it back to the way it was ne turned off auto update. hopefully that will help it. the app was fine until your dev team made unnecessary changes,4

My biggest complaint is when viewing the map it used to let you look adhead. Ir would stay in place or veiw that area. But now if you try to scan ashead to veiw a different area other than your current location it automatically drags you back to where yoy are on the map. It makes it extremely hard to trip plan. Rather than staying in place.",0
"the old version worked good. the update sucks. It always starts me in Berlin Germany. I'll set my route. when come back later my route is gone and I have to set it again.

this new update is awful. much harder to navigate through the choices around us. we want simple not this mess change it back,1
"was a decent app until it required access to unnecessary areas of my phone. no you do not need to access my photos or my contacts or anything else aside from my location, I'd uninstall if I had another option for finding places to stop.",0
This app sucks. I WILL NOT use an app that I constantly have to fight just to see what truck stops are ahead.,2
I'm not sure but I think you guys updated your app because it keeps changing over to a new format and the new format really sucks it doesn't work at all as good as the original format did,3
"Most recent update made the app practically USELESS!!!!!! Now I have to seek a replacement app! Terrible update, although the attempt was a good idea, the app crashes or freezes almost Each Time I use the routing function. And, current location disappears from the map!",2
satellite view is terrible now and it used to give the names of the businesses now doesn't please put it back the way it was,0
latest update sux,3
new update is terrible. app is either crashing and or freezing. also can't comment post button isn't working,1
after last update isnora longer full functional crash all time irritating.,0
"I'm having a lot of issues since you updated the application. it is locking up almost every time I try to check any areas for scale, fuel, parking or anything.",0
Since the update a week or two ago it constantly freezes up.,0
"your new update sucks, why do i have to create an account now.",1
"the update is horrible, why try to fix something that is not broken.",0
freezes,0
good for fuel,0
change my review from a 5 * to a 1 * because of this new update the new update is worthless. screen to try to scroll and find a truck stop and flashes back to your current location used to be good not anymore..,1
Well who hired a bunch of 3rd world Indians to program the last update? Trucker Path did! This app is now hot garbage. Spicy curry garbage.,4
"this app use to be the best app for truckers. while it still is, i hate the new update. You can no longer scroll and look at a truck stop with out it sling shotting you back your postion is. along with the much more complicated interface. i dont care that there is ads on there. i understand they need to make money too. i wish i could go back to the old truckers path before this new update",1
"This was a GREAT APP, until last night and today. I uninstalled it last night and reinstalled it and all was fine and now it goes back to, I guess this new update, which TOTALLY SUCKS! It doesn't give you the truck stop information like it used to, nor the distance and also throws off the direction, not to mention it is not functioning AT ALL like it used to. It seems frozen, and it's just a shame, who ever decided on this update just FU**ED UP A PERFECTLY GOOD APP that I used for years.",3
it's just a shame that the most recent update totally ruined what used to be a really nice app,2
"This app was awesome! It did everything a trucker needs! Everything was quickly and easily accessible and very convenientThen I was forced to accept what was presented as an update and now it is almost unusable! All that was so great about it is now gone and this is frustrating and disappointing! One day people will figure out that some things are as good as they can be and any attempt to make it better, has the reverse effect. Change, just for the sake of being seen as progressive, devalues...",0
won't tell me if scale is closed or open it keeps reading ass error,0
Why do you need access to storage to just see truck stops on my route? terrible update. i will never let you guys look into my personal files. I will use road runner from now on until I get satisfactory answer.,2
hasn't gave me any Walmart for truck,0
HORRIBLE WOULD GIVE NO STARS DOWNLOADED THIS APP TO HELP FIND WALMARTS THAT HAD TRUCK PARKING BECAUSE IT SAID IT HAD THAT OPTION I GIT IT. THAT IS SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH JUST SHOWS WHERE WALMARTS ARE THEN YOU CLICK ON THE MAP IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT I LOOKED AT ONE THAT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD SPACES FOR TRUCKS PUT IT ON GOOGLE MAPS AND IT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT WILL BE UNINSTALLING AND REPORTING THIS DECEPTION,1
price has gone up and functionality has gone down,0
was a good app you updated and went to no good,3
"CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE!!! I paid for premium with Google play but I ran into a technical issue where I couldn't use premium anymore. I emailed support, waited over a month for a copy and paste response explaining how to log in. I know how to log in. you guys obviously didn't read my email!",0
Dont be fooled by the ratings! the app developer spent more time leaving fake ratings than developing. This app is not very user friendly. Id say its poorly developed. ive been going back and forth to cancel my subscription. they are telling me thay cant do it on there end ... Lol I have to do it through the app and apparently that lil button is hidden . That was the only thing the app developer was good at... hiding the subscription delete button🤣😂 Dont waste your time or money!,1
every time I try to click on something ahead it goes back to the point I am at,0
most unfriendly user app,0
"Not too long ago, this was my most used app on my phone. Now, If I can find a similar app, I will delete Trucker Path! Due to a recent update, some moron developer decided to make this app more difficult for the driver to use, by doing away with the pinned location icons that were specific to each truck stop, such as Pilots, Loves, TA, ect. Now, all the pins are labeled with the letter P and you have to click the pin in order to see what that location is. I do not recommend this app! Imbeciles!",0
this app sucks. got me stuck in no truck street also took me out of the way. I deleted it. Jeff s beck,0
"So I'm curious as to everytime I search for trucker friendly gps app this one pops up as number one. As soon as i download it and try a location, it says routes not optimized for trucks? What's the point then?",0
"took away ability to use own routing app, forced to create an account",0
horrible app no turn-by-turn navigation complete waste of my time,1
There's multiple scale icons for 1 scale. Fuel prices are always wrong. This app keeps getting worse.,4
didnt like it at all. i got a new gps. im getting charged untill i stop it. when i clock on manage subscriptions its not on my list.,0
"app worked great prior to the update, now not so much",0
its working now thx love the app,4
DELETED PERMANENTLY this used to be a great app now it's all about money and how much of yours they can get. You can no longer use Google maps as an alternate Now you have to use their completely useless mapping system that doesn't work... time to delete and go back to the book... dumbasses...,1
"Samsung galaxy 9 owner, ever since an update a couple of months ago Everytime I close the app and reopen it, i have to input my destination over again. I've updated it and uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times but no change. please fix that small annoying bug",0
used to be a great app. I used it every time. Now its worthless to me since it doesn't have parking available anymore. sorry to say you had something really great and you messed it up. now I gotta find another app to use.,4
bot hapoy should pick up loves truck stop that ext 163 when i look its tells me i am 500 miles away when inam only 10 miles away dont tell me i need location on when it on and its brand new phone fix the app maybe ill update it,0
"Recent updates has ruined the app. Now it requests to view your devices pictures, videos, and storage taking advantage of anyone who doesn't understand they are giving away their privacy just to use its built in GPS that nobody asked for. The app takes forever to open, crashes frequently, oh and did i mention it REQUIRES YOU TO ALLOW THEM PERMISSION TO SORT THROUGH YOUR PRIVATE PICTURES, VIDEOS AND FILES TO USE GPS",0
"now wants access to photos, files, calls, callerid, and wifi control. absolutly not! you do not need that access. uninstalling untill unessesary access permisions removed. recomend all users do the same. dont become another data breach victim.",0
was the best app WAS. new update actually ruined the whole app. crashes more then half the time now,1
it used to be great but after the last update it no longer gives me option to use my Google app for routing and I don't like that.,1
"You ruined this app, it was the absolute best!!! Now it is ruined. What is up with Berlin Germany always popping up? Can't connect to Google maps anymore, it takes forever to load and it is way out of sync now with fuel spots and parking. Maybe because everyone is leaving and going to DAT Trucker like I have. Until it returns to the old outstanding app that it was, I will delete it because now it is useless to Me and My needs as a driver. -5 Stars for whom it may concern on the worst update ever!",1
"UPDATE: Now it's worse...no reviews on anything. GARBAGE APP. I used to like this app, until idiots started filling it up with useless or inaccurate information. Truck stops that aren't actually truck stops, parking spots that aren't public, etc.",2
not any good to me anymore cause it wont route to truck stop like it use to..tell that get it back I deleted and found a different one that let's you route to truck stop..and the day and night is free...sorry no good to me had it along time til now...,0
worked fine till update now you cant set up a path,0
you're new updates suck! when i hit directions it makes me use trip planner instead of Google maps. its awful!,1
this new version really sucks..,1
The latest update has made this app useless for me it no longer allows me to use Google maps. Uninstalling.,1
"I've loved this app since 2015, but after this latest update the new mapping system is laggy, the app now requires permission to access your storage just to show you routes and even though I paid for an annual membership I'm now seeing ads again. If I'm not able to downgrade the app to an older version soon I will be removing it from my phone and unsubscribing.",3
was a great app. until they updated it now i can't get directions to any place. had it for years now I'm getting rid of it. way to ruin it way do they need to keep changing things,4
The trip planner is stupid af.. It sucks it used to give me the option to choose between the trip planner and other app(Google maps) now it doesn't and i have to copy and paste the address to Google while im driving instead of just clicking and its done.. Sum dip just ruined an awsome app,0
I used the reviews to help find where to take a break. I REALLY miss them and will try other apps.,0
Reviews for places no longer show up tried to contact support says error to try again.,0
"Doesnt work for me. Cant access premium features, night mode, no ads or anything",0
Only showing 2 year old scale reviews...what's going on? Now can't view any reviews all blank. Poor system!,0
Wouldn't download,0
"it was a great app. Then they added a 4th tab for parking availability. Before, the color of the pin represented the parking availability and showed the truck stop logo. Now, you can either know what the availability is or what truck stop it is in the map view. Now, it just shows a ""P"" and is red yellow or green. Or the truck stop logo and all the pins are red. Why would they do this? You now have to click more to know the same amount of information. Also, If you search for a place and click ""show on map"", the only pin you see is that one place. Now go back to the main map and you lost that location and have no way of returning without scrolling with your finger and hoping to find that location just so you know what else is in that area. This app was not developed with the fact that 99% of the time it is being used while driving. It isn't designed by drivers and the developers really don't understand the concept of being user friendly. It has potential but they currently have no desire to make things easier to use, the proof is that 4th parking availability tab. I don't want to give comments a thumbs up or down, this isn't YouTube. I want to find a place to park so I can get some rest. I emailed my inquiry and they responded with an automated response thanking me for my input, no actual conversation about why they changed it and how it is supposedly safer to click more while you are driving. They have made it less safe and don't care about it. I canceled my subscription, they don't get anymore of my money.",0
"The latest update is awful. Makes it virtually useless. No longer links to Google maps, and internal router doesn't give directions. Very dissappointed and am an avid user",3
It used to be better before now it sucks .not showing cities where are you at only states also not showing option to use Google maps,1
"Since last update its very slow , will not give you the right info,",0
Used for years but the latest update took the google map link out. Useless now. I'll go back to the paperback book and check exit numbers. Took a great and amazing app and ruined it. Good job developers. Uninstalled,3
App is no where near being accurate. Tells you if parking spots that are not parking at all. Tells you there are spots when there are not.,0
new upgrade works wrong. old version was better. Do something with it please,0
no gmaps = 1☆,0
"What happened to directions to places. Return GM platform. U gave us a choice before, now stuck with laughable turn by turn. It's a joke. Seems like you are aiming for storage access. Bring back GOOGLE MAPS CHOICE",1
This was a great app to use. They updated it and took away the conneto google maps for routing. There is no longer a way to contact them for support. The update didnt even fix the duplicate icons for the same location.,1
"Use to be a good app. Not anymore. Won't let you choose between Google maps or trip planner, trying to gater info about a truck stop... Not possible because will bring you back to my location point.... Prices not accurate at all... Some times difference is up to 20 cents",4
Well I can't use my Google maps any more so by by,1
Apparently you will be bringing back Google maps back. Until then I will have to find another app to use. Kind of hard to cut and paste addresses. What good is a trip planner of you can't go right into a map. I'll be looking for the update.,1
The update sucks told me there was a Love's truck stop and it was not a love that was a pilot and it don't account for traffic,0
Was the best app ever until recent update ! Deleted and chose another....smh,2
Can't use Google maps anymore.. The routing system on app it's awful,1
"Every time I try and get directions for truck friendly roads it says ""not optimized for trucks""! Kind of defeats the whole purpose of the app doesn't it?",3
Put google maps navigation (other app) back in app,1
You guys have really screwed this app up. Used to be a great app,4
I culdent downlode the app,0
"I used to use this app every day, but it has become unusable with this latest update onThanksgiving weekend. My route will disappear if the screen goes to sleep, it wont center on my location, and sometimes displays the center of Berlin instead of the route I designated. Even inputting a simple route between two large cities causes the app to spit out error codes. But hey, the advertising in the review section runs great! RiP truckerpath...",3
"Can't down load it,keep saying download pending, been saying it for days.",0
Since last update the app is not working properly. Please fix it. I took it off my phone,3

BEWARE-NOW IS OWNED BY THE CHINESE! app literally updated itself without my permission and completely changed it's appearance and functions. I'm not keeping anything in my phone that can make changes without my permission.,0
Does not have voice turn by turn. Unable to contact company for refund. Pointless and dangerous app if you have to read directions while driving. .....,0
"The upgrade you guys did messed the old perfect App, reverse it to the original one",0
What happened to all the mile marker exit numbers? Like I want to know where I have to turn. They used to b there. Now most of them are gone,0
Crashes 5.1.1,0
Causing unrelated pop ups,4
I uninstalled it. Completely f******* useless.,0
They post any review in a second but won't accept fuel price updates.,0
As a free app was great... As a paid service I no longer have a use for it. Maybe get the truck stops pay for it an list fuel prices since the stops benefit the most,4
Use more mile markers. It doesn't show to the minute when a weigh station opened or closed. The time of day is also wrong.,2
Not optimized for trucks is what the maps said. REALLY?,0
I pay the membership fee and now with a recent update... ads all over the place. Need to correct asap. Support doesn't respond to any support requests.,2
To hard to navigate type in a city where there is a truck stop nothing found its a pilot,0
Why can't I leave a review on the places that I visit it only asked me to say if the lot is full or empty since I can't leave the review it says please update status instead of leaving a review so I can help other drug Truckers why am I not allowed to leave a review,0

"Just doesn't work for me, thanks.",0
HORRIBLE STAY AWAY !!! I NEED A REFUND NOT A TURN BY TURN COMMERICAL GPS. DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DRESS IT UP LIKE A TURN BY TURN GPS. ONLY TO LIST REST STOPS AND WEIGHING STATIONS. DRIVING COMMERCIAL IS STRESSING To begin with. I DONT NEED THese leach apps adding to my stress,2
App was really good for a while. Now it has a bug that tells me error happened and it won't show me if the weigh stations are open. It's the most important feature and it's not working.,4
Full of advertising,0
This app as far as I'm concerned only get to one star you said I would have given it five stars but they taking away voice so when you are not able to see the map while it's in a holder like a cradle you cannot tell where you got to go when you got to make a turn or how far you've got because you don't have the voice activation anymore so when I put the phone down I can't see the map I don't like it that's not good the map was good before the last update I still can look up all the places that I've always looked up but when you hit directions and the guidance there is no voice so you have to be able to watch the map as you drive,0
No way to find cheap fuel enroute,0
"Once was the best, now their the greedy, when told that drivers make less than minimum wage I was told ""WE HAVE SUPPORTED DRIVERS LONG ENOUGH"" drop them for Road Hunter, seems like the best alternative and EDIT YOUR RATING, let's show em what happens when the best reason for this app it customers walk away. Still think charging the people that make this app worthwhile need to pay when we contribute and that's the only reason for your sucess?",0
Nothing but filth. User reviews need to be censored for language and sex services.,0

there, there are a lot of spots and the place is very clean. Moving on.

location ivon is active, i force close this app and location icon goes off. 
now it starts when i restart phone(in background and tracks every 
movement). the service this app provide is not uncommon. removing and never 
using again as i can get same services elsewhere without having this app

I have to do a ""force stop"" to keep it from running, but an hour later it starts running again.  I have written to the developers TWICE about this and they haven't bothered to respond.

"Was my primary app to either find cat scales and or a place to shut my eyes 
for the night but the most recent update left this app crippled i have 
attempted three times to reach out to their support team and have never 
gotten an answer back",2
"The GPS side of it blows, no turn by turn directions",0
"Can't get info anymore , like phone numbers amount of parking stop has no. Showers address , app is now failing , why ?",0
"Now with overpriced paid subscription, none of the parking data is up to 
date, only paid users can update, which are few & far between. So all the 
scale & parking data is unreliable now.",0
"Now greedily blocks view of parking status with ads from map view.  The word ""white"" is censored along with cussing apparently.   Mostly useless ""reviews"" with a lot of sexual requests & non factual opinion pieces.   App on the decline...",0
"Since update app has turned to garbage can't get reviews can't see history 
total junk please fix as this USED to be one of my favorite tools to use 
now its total junk",3
"Was a great helpful app but after doing update I can no longer do updates 
or look at reviews and it keeps putting pop up ads covering the statuses",0
"Latest update broke the app. When tapping a location description from the map, it delays then goes to am all black screen.",3
Screen goes black when I attempt to see reviews and other info. Fix now,0
Your update sucks advertisements in the way of parking status and now it goes to a map view but doesnt show parking status clearly. Give you one week to fix then its gone.,0
Useless app after latest update. Won't provide fuel prices or info. Used to work fine until latest update. Deleting...,3
"I am constantly force stopping this app because it runs in the background using GPS which uses ALOT of battery, on the flip side this app does have alot of useful information that is constantly up to date but the battery usage is a vary hard fail (100% to 40% in 2 hours) I am forced to uninstall.",0
I guess new update is to blame click on truck stop to view info all I get is black screen and phone is brand new s9,1
Its says free but then it ask for contributions,0
Too many ads even with the membership doesn't always work and is always in accurate... What a joke,0
"Shows stations that doesn't have road diesel, want out of my way to refuel, station only had bio diesel. Wasted time & fuel.",0
It used to be a great tool but now unless you pay for the premium version  the parking status is covered by adds,3
"App used to be very useful. Then the ads started covering the most pertinent information, rendering it useless. Uninstalling.",3
"It's a ""free"" app that blocks out the truck stop parking information unless you upgrade to the pay version. It's helpful if other truckers update the info on truck stops, but blocking the info unless you pay is b.s.",2
Can't see parking updates from main screen anymore because they are covered by ads. Uninstalling.,0
"This app seems to be getting worse, not better. I'm almost at the poor of finding a new app. When looking for restaurants near a truck stop using the restaurant tab it now gives banks tire places atms. That makes absolutely no sense.",0
Switch to truckbubba ..Ruined it with poorly placed  ads just like every. Other app out there,0
They put ADS over the parking status. That is just lame.,0
Sucks,0
You can't update status of scales anymore,0
Up till a couple weeks ago this was a five star ap p now at 70 miles an hour going down the expressway with corn fields on both sides of the road the app ask me if the lot is full or not the app is gone to s*** in the last couple weeks,0
"Used to be fine, now the ads cover the parking availability, and they beg for reviews over and over. Here's a review for you: your app needs fixing. Reviews for places are full of idiots to boot. Reviews need some kind of approval system so the pages aren't full of ""parking? Parking? Beer? Oh how many spots open? Is there beer here?"" Etc. I'm at my wit's end with this thing.",0
Was a good app to have now it's plastered with adds over the parking status and won't show the exit number anymore I'm moving on this app now sucks if your looking for a good app go to trucker bubba,3
"Doesnt work anymore, started using Road Hunter app, much better, real truck routes and better support",4
You ruined the app with those ads!,2
Ads covering parking availability just about has me to the point of uninstalling. Fix soon or your app is going to be useless because we are all going to leave.,0
"Here is the serious issue I have with the app.  Every time I pass by a place that is on the map such as a scale house or truck stop.  Or rest area.  The app DOES NOT NEED TO ASK ME EVERY SINGLE TIME WHILE DRIVING WHAT DOES THE PARKING LOOK LIKE AND IS THE SCALE HOUSE OPEN OR CLOSD.  IT IS DISTRACTED DRIVING,  you need to fix that issue,  there is no reason the ask me a dam thing when I pass a scale house.  Us drivers know when we get there, because there is a dam sign that says open or closed.  ALSO I don't care about the scale house for the opposite traffic.  SO QUIT ASKING ME ABOUT THAT TOO.  this is why I am giving you a 1 star and which I could give zero.  There should be a option in the app that enables you to not ask about that stuff while driving.  Let alone you should make a drive mode option.  If I don't see an update,  or any response  to this review for future plans or solutions, I will just report this app to google for possible distracted driving.  Many of us drivers use this app just to have it open,  and to glance at.  Not to be touching our tablets or phones while driving because your curious if a place has parking or not.",2
Need to remove the adds on screen so I can see parking instead of some add,0
This app used to be amazing. They've since sold out to a foreign company. First thing said company did was stick ads over the parking status updates. If it weren't for sheer number of users I'd completely forsake it for the Samsung app.,3
"Use to love this app, now I'm frustrated. Can't do what I was accustom to doing with in the app. Very dissatisfied with it, had been using it for a long time, now out of nowhere it is saying that the app may not be optimized for my device. I also sent two reports on this matter only to not have someone respond to them.",4
"The ""free load board"" is non existent. When I click on it, it routes me to the google play store where it says: Item not found.",0
"No longer useful, they have placed adds covering much needed parking info. They made this app pointless.",0
This now has an add where the parking  availability is. This is now a useless app. AND YOU WANT US TO FEED INFO?,0
"This app would be 5 stars. Up until a few days ago it was extremely helpful. Then they updated it. Now when you click a truck stop to see status there's a giant ad blocking status. So when you have stacks of stops in one area, it's extremely difficult to tap, tap, tap to find spots. Now, tap stop, open it up to see status, close it, tap a few times to get to the next one, rinse and repeat. Let's be realistic here. We use this going down the road. The less clicks the better. I have no problem with ads, as long as they don't interfere. These interfere in the worst way. Funny enough, I opened it up to buy it right after the update because I like supporting products i use. Then I saw the ad placement. Nope. Way to ruin a good thing.",0
"Why isnt there any options to customize truck info like if your driving 13ft box truck need to know where low bridges are... also no option to remove what is displayed on map, this is seriously useless.. app sucks and they want 20$ for night mode? Lmfao. if someone needs to know where walmart or any info you have stuck on map their google maps does that anddd more! A free truck app that actually works would be nice like google maps yet you can customize your vehicle info to avoid areas where it doesnt fit.",1
For most part unreliable...,0
Sold off...to the CHINESE.....No thanks!!!!! ZERO STARS FOR SELLING OUT,0
"I wanted this to route me through the truck routes, but all I see are truck stops and weigh stations.  Useless to me.",4
Paid for premium service but cannot login or use service. Seems to be little customer support for this app,0
This thing is wrong just past the scale and they was open,0
wont let me login,4
Annoying contact and spamming. After I uninstalled their app they kept spamming me after multiple complaints. They still are spamming me.   The app is medocre at best. It's desiged as a data miner so I would suggest you avoid it.,0
Tried an adress that i drive a tractor trailer to and it gave only the car route....usless,0
What happened to the update button? I can't find it on my screen. Can't update weather scales are open or closed.,0
I want the old version back... you updated app and ruined it,0
It kick you out when u try to navigate with the GPS,0
Sucks,0
Absolutely hate this app. It will not update my current location. It keeps saying I'm in another state.,0
"Annoying drive by questions about available parking, not related to route.",0
Again you changed the symbols on the map.  I don't know if it's a Loves or  Petrol without clicking on it. If it's not brick don't fix it.  Who ever came up with changing it should be fired...,2
Sucks,0
"It isn't set up for big trucks. All it says is that they are working on it. What are supposed to do, pull over and wait?",0
Do not care for trucker path the only thing i like is the load finder and finding weight station or sometimes if i need a truck stop the trip planner is useless and does not navigate at all other than that a very stupid app,0
Drove around for about 6 hours trying to find a weight station every single one i when to on the app didnt exist,0
"Embedding Google Maps into the app is a bad idea. When it re-routes, it opens maps outside of tp. Also, the extra clicks to choose a program EVERY time. I should be able to choose a default and not have to click through to using gm every time. DON'T EMBED MY APPS IN YOUR APP. IT DOESN'T WORK WELL THAT WAY.",3
please remove latest update.,3
The new update it horrible can I get the old version back,1
updated version had me on the country back roads of Alabama was some scary stuff go back to old version this one is for cars,0
App says route not for truckers had me mapped on a restricted road useless,0
1st route I punched in. This app wanted to send me down a no truck parkway . And a 2nd option route had a low brigde . Lucky for me I knew this info before I hauled ass..your app sucks donkey B's..,0
"This app was good, but now not so good. The map display hasn't been working. It's useless without​the map.",0
Routed me to 110 N to Pasadena Ca. Which every truck driver in Southern California knows that it is not a truck route,2
Terrible app ruined it with update,0
Weigh station revies show up in a random order. Fix it,2
"New update, no triad roads or road numbers now...pathetic",1
"Night mode held behind a $2/month paywall? Wow. As this app gets more popular the greed of its makers increases. I've been using this app for 2 years. I got annoyed a while ago when they allowed truck stops to pay them to have their icons stay on the map permanently, no matter how you adjust the filters. I purposely avoid those places because of that annoyance. Now a monthly subscription ""premium"" service with no ads and night mode. Worth the price? NOT EVEN CLOSE. Expect them to make the ads more annoying so you will become a premium member. Also expect them to remove normal features of the app that they will put behind the $2/mo paywall. It's going downhill fast folks. They're seeing nothing but dollar signs. I understand they have every right to profit off of this app, but a subscription service is not the way. It feels so sleezy. Suggestion: a one time fee of $5. I'd pay that.",1
Downloaded the app to drive a commercial vehicle and the first destination I put in it suggested me to take a Parkway. Kind of useless.,0
Just go buy a Garmin Dezi.  Has everything you could want in a gps system.  Thats what i did and it works wonders!!,0
"I work for a company, not my truck, so I dont need the loads thing. But Im with you, for long time now. And you telling me there I have to pay for the Night mode. ??????",2
When did Idaho. Become Ohio..,0
Used to be great it got uninstalled  now that I re installed it it will not work very sad,3
Stopped working was a great app but now won't show roads pre route nothing,4
"Interstates; Highways; SR's; CR's; streets; etc are still unaddressed & hard to see. Stop identifying every gas station as, a truck stop. They're not. Start identifying TOLL roads, as such. There are new POE's and scale-houses, out here. Get them on your program. Its time to step up to the big league, junior, if you want us real truckers to use your program, and not just the, ""cookie-cutter"" drivers who just came from McDonalds & Taco Bell, and think they're professionals.    ""X""",0
Crap app with all of the idiots on it. Don't leave any negative reviews on stops or you'll be blocked. Uninstalled.,0
It simply sucked. I was forced to purchase a GPS,0
"After the update when you try to plan a route it only gives car route with no truckstops, scales etc.",0
Having problems again. This recent update suck and screws up everything that was good. Bring back what you had cause I won't use this app anymore,2
Enjoy the app. Then it upgraded and now all I can get is route for cars. Before I could search for truck stops rest areas along my route but not any more,2
"Totally perplexing app, doesn't intuitively allow me to find information I need, when I want it. Seems as it's always been in development. I had high hopes it would deliver on basic needs. As an OTR driver, I give it a Fail and no more of my time. Deleting now.",3
"This app was awesome but after last update it be came a shot, I dont get to see weight stations status or truck stops status pls fix it",2
"The scale status stopped working when I used it and it would give only error messages, so I deleted it.",0
Sucks,0
Would like if you added new loves travel stops in the usa,0
Want scale info only,0
After the update doesn't show scales wether theyre open or close and still not a truck route,4
It's crap. Set my trip on a parkways and no truck routes.,4
Its bullshit how you have to pay  to see the fuel prices,4
This does not give you commercial truck routes typed a location to check it and told me to take the cross island parkway that is not a commercial route passenger vehicles only,4
Used to be good,3
Can we stop with the forced updates? Not everyone is so lucky to have unlimited data and we like to stretch it out as far as possible,0
After recent update you have to pay in order to see diesel prices. This is the only reason I was using it. Now this app is worthless.,2
Why is this asking for in app purchase permission to update? I'm not purchasing anything. Its been free as long as I've had it. Im not going to start paying for it now. //Why is there anything to purchase? What purchasable features have been added?,0
$$$$ got in way of a great app. U guys  r still wanting 4.99 to tell me fuel prices and navigation . I can get all this for free else where other apps.,4
App just did an update now it won't open at all.,0
"TAKE A BIG CAUTION!!!  THIS DOES NOT WORK.    I ARRIVED AT A SCALE THAT WAS OPEN. THIS APP,      SHOWED IT WAS CLOSED.      KEEP AWAY!!!!",2
"I used this app every day. I woke up this morning and it said I need to update it. After the update, I can't use the trip planner any more without paying a monthly fee. So much for a good ""FREE"" truck GPS app. I'm un-installing it now.",2
"It's a great app. Although when it forces me to update to use it pissed me off. I periodically update apps on my phone after reading that there are no issues with an update that is being installed. But when app simply strong arms you into updating it  that's an automatic 1star rating from me. It used to be a 5star rated app but, sadly, it is no more",4
Couldnt get info,0
"As a truck driver I was pretty excited.  I downloaded the app and was impressed with some of the features,  but then,  I tried to figure out how to use the navigation system. That's when I started realizing that this was not the app for me or anyone else for that matter.  The GPS doesn't actually give you turn by turn navigating and when you type in your location a system message reads that this app is NOT designed for truck routes!!!?   WTH. THE WHOLE APP IS DESIGNED FOR TRUCKS!! Waisted my time.  Thanks!",2
"App now wants you to pay to see restaurants, already too much abuse with people marking the parking full, not worth $5 a month! Deleting app & will install another app",0
I've used this app for long time free now you have to pay for certain things on it SUCKS,0
I have unstalled app an reinstall app 4 times called at&t an it still wants me to sign up for 4.99 a month VIP deal it locks fuel $ so you can't see them an won't let you use plan trip,4
This app was a good app then you want to start charging for something that was free I think you suck and need to stop producing apps if you have to try to rip off the market that made you who you are,3
You're charging five dollars a month for something I used for free for so long. I would do a one time purchase of around three bucks but that's about it.,0
If I want to pay for info I would keep it.  New update killed it for me try truck Bubba it's free,0
Put previously free features behind a pay wall! Brilliant!,0
Now you want to charge to view the restaurants at the locations?? Delete,0
Did it occur to any of the developers that it might not be a good idea to put crowd-sourced features behind a paywall?,0
"This app is horrible. If i had actually used it in an unfamiliar area, i would have ran into a bridge. Do not trust.",0
$4.99 monthly....you lost your damn mind,0
$5 per month! You've got to be joking!,0
Went from free to pay... Zero stars.,0
They did pay for TRUCK PATH time to get back to paper truck stop book,0
Used to use this app all the time to find truck stops along my route but not worth it for 5 a month. After 10 months you could buy a tnd t80,2
Not only have they gone and put a pay wall up they hid the restaurants behind that wall,0
"Sorry but even tho I like this application, I will not pay $4.99 a month for using it. I am uninstalling your app.",0
This 499 a month charge for features that were free before the last update is really going to drive users away. We as drivers give you the updates but you want to charge us for looking at it.  Charge for routes if you must but charging for information we drivers provided for free is wrong.,0
For an app that use to show everything for free. Plain ol stupid. Ya'll have lost your damn minds!,1
Not free anymore!,0
Prices are not right parking updates not acceptable.not worth 4.99 a month for inaccurate info. Like knowing were truck stops and stuff is but not going to pay you everyone likes to rip off truckers. What happened to free app.,2
I have found this app to very useful but it is not worth $60 year. I took a look at Road Hunter and it seems like it will be an acceptable replacement.,0
Used to use all the time. Uninstalling due to paywall,0
It worked great before the update now I/you can't get in anymore now back to the old way fix this,0
"I realize that you need to make money, but the features that you froze unless paid for are actually provided by Google Maps, or feedback from other truckers (parking and weigh station closures, for example). You aren't paying them, but are charging us. I really liked the interface you provided, but as a team, we can go to Google and find the information you have locked us out of. I'll be looking for something that doesn't charge for free services. CBL",2
Uninstalling to due app getting greedy,0
"Just found the reason to uninstall this app, now you have to pay for whats been free..",0
"This app is massed up all the way around. It shows wrong fuel prices, wrong scale status. Dosnt show all scales. Don't trust them. And now they want you to pay for it. Wrong and greedy. There are much better trucker apps. DELETING!",0
"Been using your app for years... now changed added a second cell phone and this one is saying $4.99/month?? I could understand maybe $20/year or ads or charging big truck dealers/vendors but drivers?? I'm going to look for other apps. Sad smh 😔 FYI, Just found ROAD HUNTER, switching to that app.",1
Absolutely do not update to newer versions if you have a free version the newer versions require a monthly paid subscription i guarantee i personally will Not update status of anything.!,0
I had rated this awesome. Now they want $5 - $10 a month! Big big mistake! Way too much!Awesome app! Use it daily. Just wish vulgar commentators were booted. Also seems to take extremely long time to correct wrong info.,1
"Now that features I used are no longer free, time to find a new app",0
Was great until you had to start paying,0
"Stop the canned responses. You didn't tell anyone you were going to start charging for the built in functionality. You didn't support the trucking community, we supported you with all the vital reviews and parking updates, etc. You even got paid via ads for people using your app. You gave us a great template and we gave you the information you needed, then you turned around and stabbed us all in the back. Apologise for this, give us back the free app and charge for new features that we've asked for.",1
"This app used to be my go to app, but that is changing. $4.99 to see fuel prices and view history? I could see $0.99 a month maybe. Greed will kill this app. Just like everyone else out there, trying to get rich off a truck driver. Time for a boycott.... 10-4",2
I recently changed phones and had to redownload the app. It sucks. Most of it is locked and I have to pay $4.99 a month just to be able to get the price of fuel. What a waste.,0
"Looked up 3 trips, and tried a 4th, and it has the pad lock on it. Thanks anyway, but I'll pass, I'll keep looking for another.",0
App used to be awesome. Looks like the dev decided instead of having a great app he wanted to cash in on truckers. I have no problem when a dev has ads or a pay version but not 2 years after its been free to use. Changing the game midstream is just wrong. Guess the dev is just a money hungry jerk. A one time purchase fee is one thing but a monthly charge is just bull. FYI CHANGED TO ROADHUNTER SAME AS OLD TRUCKER PATH BUT NO EXTRA CHARGES.,4
Had this app for over 2 years. Now I have to pay a subscription to use features I already had.,1
"Don't need your copy and pasted bs sorry excuse. We truckers get screwed enough as it is! Thanks for one more screw over! Check out Truck Bubba, same features but free!",2
Why why wand why..... all necessary features where free and special useful and now you have to pay. Gesh,0
"Once was a great app.  Could deal with advertising and what not.  But, after update has turned into a bust. Yes you get the some things for free.. but, now even the history of a station is pay to see. REALLY! That history and most of the updates are done by your so called basic plan users and would have never got off the ground to where it is now.  What a huge let down and a I'll never update anything on this period because of this.  I hope more follow suit.",4
"$9.99 per month are you kidding me. Greedy devs took away many features that made this a once great app that was the best of its kind. I'd pay $10 a year but not a penny more. I'm telling everyone I know to dump this way over priced app. Don't bother with the copy and paste ""so sorry"" reply message, WE THE TRUCKING COMMUNITY MADE THIS APP GREAT, WE SUBMITTED THE PARKING AREAS, WE REVIEWED THE TRUCK STOPS, WE UPDATE WEIGH STATIONS, WE RATED YOUR APP, WE TOLD OUR FRIENDS. All you did is borrow Google map API Add a server/data base. WITHOUT US TRUCKERS YOU DON'T HAVE AN APP, YOU'RE THIEVES!!! Add banners ads, if you must, works for everyone else on the play store, greedy losers. GET ""ROAD HUNTER"" IT'S NEARLY AS GOOD, IT'S FREE AND WE THE TRUCKING COMMUNITY CAN MAKE IT GREAT!",4

4.99 for same functions that were free.... hmm way to screw your user base that made this app popular.... see how many people leave.... also monthly fee..... unfortunately you guys are going to go the way of bigroad application. One time fee would of been much better.,0
Lets boycott these fags! No one buy the subscription!,0
*Edit* This used to be the best app in existence until some developer got greedy and is now charging to be able to use half of it. 10 bucks a month are you kidding me?!?!?! Just to find a thermo king or a kenworth? Take that greedy corporate B.S. somewhere else. Put in adds if you want to make payroll. *End Edit*               This app is the ultimate tool for drivers. Thanks guys keep it up!,0
Latest update they made a lot of the old features to paid now. Was a great app till this update. Now I'm restoring my phone from a few days ago to get the old up date.,3
"A week ago i would have given this app 5 stars not anymore. As a trucker this app is a huge help in finding places that are decent to stay at and all other important info that truckers need. But now you are going to charge us a monthly fee to use the trip planner, view diesel prices, find out what the parking status is at each of the truck stops, and not be able to see what our food options are.!? I will be deleting this app and finding another one. Thanks for making truckers jobs even harder than they were",2
"You're on interstate 80W in Laramie, Wy and it says impossible route to Salt Lake City,Ut. .wow. .in other words it can't find you truck stops towards salt lake city..this app used to be great before all the extra updates..I definitely wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. .sorry..",3
"Are you serious??? now there is a monthly change for full features it was good until this day why pay if I can use other apps without paying download ""My ONE20"" it gives you all the information you need for free switching to that one better",0
"Great when it was free, but they got greedy. Time to look for an alternative...",0
Who! Now you want me for something that is lieing to me.,0
"Fuel prices Google maps will give u, Fuelbook will give u free too and route  u. You guys didn't support truckers, for 3 years but used them to make ur app better. We made this app popular.  By recommending it to less tech savvy people as well. Change the pricing to something fair. And most likely more people will buy it, 5$/10$ per month may not seem expensive to some ppl but sure does feel like a betrayal and definitely a rip off...monthly pricing is BS...",4
"It was very useful, as truckdrivers would help each other.  And now you have to pay $5.00 a month to use it. Update. And as far as their response has functionality , no it has changed for a monthly fee is ludicrous and pure greed is everybody else would just ask for a one-time payment to use their product you better get their head out of their ass. As they realize people are going to go to something else",0
"Used to be a decent app until they started charging for features that were free before. And the pricing is ridiculous, too many other apps do the same thing without trying to pick your pocket.",0
"This app starts itself, runs in the background ALL the time and was sucking up 56% of my battery.  I wonder what it was really doing?",0
"BUT this app is slooooow as hell, it freezes all day for a few seconds but thats enough to get me on a bad mood making wanna punch the phone. Can you Please FIX the LAGGING. this app is great but damn the lagging",0
Used to enjoy app. Now u hwve to pay to see weigh station history and restaurants near truck stop. Going uninstall app right now,2
UPDATE: more updates and still slowing with each update. I just don't get why devs mess with things that worked. Smh! . . . . . Recent updates have made this app painfully slow. It used to open so quick and now you wait and wait for it to load. Don't get me started on the pop up ads!,0
"Very first destination I put in the app said ""this route not yet optimized for trucks"".  From Wichita,  KS to Clackamas,  OR.",0
Confusing,0
"Parking, hotels, restaurants and rest areas are super to have current information on",0
Won't open after recent update,2
Love it,0
list mode function does not work  when you route planning it gives you inaccurate information,0
Won't stay with the route.,0
Very bugy after the last updates.  The app bands plenty of words that are useful for truckers like lot lizards.,0
Have to unstall ever time use,0
"A lot better then having those old truck stop books.  So much easier to trip plan now! (Update 9/10/16*** I use to love this app but I've had nothing but issues with it when it comes to planning my route. Even routes I've planned before is coming up as an ""impossible route"". I even contacted the app customer service with no help. Third reinstall I'll see if that works.)",0
I use this app all the time everyday. This past week it has gone downhill anddoes not show me the highways like before. All I get is a blank screen and lucky if I get the truck stops to show up. Then when I do and I click on one it might tell me 8 miles but then when I click on the directions it will tell 15 miles to go. All of this in the past week. I have Uninstaller and reinstalled and it does not change anything.,2
Don't pester me to rate your app,0
It used to be good now after updating it a few times it keeps get worse it won't let me update weather the scale is open or closed if I'm already passed it so much for truckers letting others know what's going on maybe they should just leave thing's alone rather than messing with it and messing it up,4
Won't change incorrect info and there is alot of it...unreliable half the time,0
"No information comes easy on this app. Everything is a pain in the butt.  I have tried to like it for 2 months, and I am uninstalling it now.  DAT truckers app is much better and much easier to understand.",0
Fuel prices never correct now 4 months later and no corrections to the programming,4
Only shows the major brand truck stops and not all fueling stations.,2
Impossible route,0
App recommend NY's Northern State Parkway - road closed to commercial traffic and has numerous low bridges.,0
Used to really like the app. After update l go in and have to locate myself (i.e.it shows ohio and i m in fl.) Will be uninstalling if it doesnt start working correctly,0
How to use it for  navigation? It won't work for me.,0
Truckdriver,0
"Last update make it this application very slow and is lagging every time when I'm trying to see information about places or move the map. We don't need better application design. We need only the fast, correct information . It was a good application without last update.",2
"Did you people seriously sensor the word ""Swift"" in the review section? What did they get their feelings hurt for drivers calling them out?",0
Now its a piece of crap,0
"Great when trip planning, just great to have for anyone on the road traveling and a must have for truckers",0
"After I downloaded the new version my Android phone kept crashing. Then I seen there was an update and still the same. So I uninstalled and tried it again, same thing :(",1
Was great b4 update not at all good now,0
New version sucks,1
The old one was more better,0
Keeps telling me no possible route from Houston TX to Dallas TX,0
"Do not trust this app it set me down a non legal truck route and almost cost me $5,000 my Qualcomm is down which is made in truck navigation and Communications device so I downloaded this app because it says it will show truck routes that is a horrible lie and horrible understatement I wish I could get this 0 Stars.   In reply to your comment about not being an official GPS app and how you're not quote into GPS and routes for truckers then maybe you really shouldn't call yourselves truckers path",4
I don't know what you did to this app but I am 9 miles from the truck stop and it still says I am 48 miles away whatever you've done to it you need to fix it because this is just a headache dealing with this app now,2
Difficult to navigate through,0
Thanks for creating this very helpful app. I recommend this app for all professional drivers....update you removed driver comments.  That kinda makes this a 1 star app . It was a great app till you did that.,4
Hate the new update always goes back to somewhere in TN,1
Liked old app better when you  do a trip plan it does not  bring  back up tricksters and rest areas back up you have to do  another  trip  plan to get  them  to  show up  again sucks,0
Can't zoom into where you are you have to find yourself,0
"UNINSTALLED. And I have got non-sence, stupid reply.",0
After stupid update. I cant update the scale anymore.. not good,0
You have ruined this app...the new version is terrible to be polite.,1
Once again your update made the app worse now it keeps saying impossible route even if I set route turn off app and plug in exact same thing it will then say impossible route also I keep getting unknown error when I click on anything and look at directions for miles I have to copy address and plug into map because yall app stop working,3
Unuseable,0
"Asks every day to rate it, here you go.",0
Make it better,0
Sucks balls,0
"Bring back the history on this app. Otherwise it ain't worth much to me anymore,",0
How are you getting a 4.7 when truckers have to take risks navigating with this app,0
Thanks for updating the application with crappy icons. Also now everytime I  Ieave a review it crashes.,0
Sent us down roads closed to trucks,0
"The new icons are awesome but we need different colors cause all the red dots look the same, leave loves red, make ta red and blue, petro green and FJ and pilot yellow",0
You stopped posting fuel and location of the mom and pop truckstops  You paid by the big expensive truckstops?,0
Go back to original version. You had it right the first time.,0
"It opens only if i open Google Play &gt; Trucker Path. It's all good , dozens other apps have the functionality of this app too. Don't need it.",3
App has not worked properly since it updated it will open but the maps never come up,0
Bullshit,0
"First trip,  and it sends you on highways that I know for a fact, don't allow trucks.",0
I loved the previous version and had next to no problems.....until i went for the updated version. Ive already left email to truckerpath but got no responses as to why i now see white squares in place of the truckstop company icons. It now makes it impossible for me to plan ahead. I use a galaxy s5 with the lollipop os in my phone.,0
"Did the update today and it's just absolutely slow...takes almost a whole minute to show the satellite veiw, I have AT&T 4G, and it's not the problem.",0
"Bad,slow , lagging  make the ios version.this is just embarassing",0
"Last version have a lot of  graphics problems lost truck stops and weight station icons, part of map !!!! Please fix that !!!",2
"Best trucker app ever!! But, too many steering wheel hlolders giving bad parking updates. Thanx guys!!!!",0
"I use this app just for scales status and it's never accurate it's always the opposite of what it says. I got loaded was going to weight myself I suspected overweight and the app said the scale was closed but guess what it wasn't and I paid for it and the parking status is also never accurate. Will never use this app again, uninstalling.",2
Why are you using Google for driving directions they don't have truck routing?,0
"Tried sending me down a weight restricted road luckily I am a driver so I knew it was wrong,",0
Why does this not show flying j or pilots?,0
The app does not open up when I tap it fix it Jesus!,0
Can't get to work,0
I was able to classify weigh stations or rest areas or truck stops. Now you have to zoom to get to a weigh station truck stop or rest area very clunky,2
This thing is garbage first thing it does when I put in an address was send me to a Parkway,0
To much on app motels prices on fuel just need scale fuel stops that's it,0
Whatever you changed put it back the way it was,0
"Not sure why would this app needs access to so many areas of my phone, it wouldn't even leave alone my Google account.",0
"You must have location on or it will not let you use it. Previous version would ask you to turn it on and after checking no you could use it until you closed it. Now you can't do that, I will keep poping up non-stop until you turn it on. Thalk about big brother tracking you even in apps!",0
Used to be a great app until the last update it crashes and has even crashed my phone completely saying this app put a virus on my phone.,4
"Cross Island Parkway in NY is not a truck road. This app used it as a truck route.  Also, this app routed me onto Belt Parkway in NY.  Be advised that Belt Parkway is not a truck route.  Low overpasses.",4
Why can't I remove the rest area option? I don't use rest area's & I don't want them on my map while I'm trying to find truck stops!,0
This app is useless it told me to take a parkway to my destination. NO TRUCKS ON PARKWAYS,2
My truckers path icon on home screen no longer opens the app after update and icon in my app list is no longer there.. please fix,0
You can count the word Muslim you tell me I can say non-english-speaking immigrants in stations truck stops I'm trying to better my fellow trucker out here on the road but yet you treat my freedom of speech the First Amendment to the Constitution United States is a bad thing you totally f****** suck at this You See Kay,2
Do not keep asking me a rating.,0
What the hell happened to this thing? Just makes my phone blink and don't do squat!,0
App doesn't open on my phone. Samsung Galaxy S3,3
Great app,4
Still doesn't work on my OP2. Worked updated doesn't work again.,0
Bad update,0
The old version was better was easy to use this version is harder im just delete it easier to use the randmcnally then this.,0
here u go,0
New version is not user friendly,1
"I provided feedback twice, why does it only show open and closed for weigh station? It should have 3 options for drivers to update accurately OPEN, CLOSED AND NO BODY HOME. So we know whether it's temp closed or no body home means no one working inside.",2
Owner operator,0
Don't. Work eneymore,0
Zero refresh rate. You have to close and reopen app for real time info. Now what? The weigh station button is gone. Useless app.,2
Updated it and now no weight station quick report,0
I wouldn't  recommend  this app. I ran out of fuel going to places  this app said there would  be a fuel station. This app cost me a load and I have to find road side to come in before  I freeze  to death,0
Easy to use my butt it won't go past the first point with the numbers on it,0
"Used to be able to pull up menu at bottom of map on Android to filter for walmart only,  or Loves only. As of 2/17 upgrade, can't do that anymore.",0
Crashes alot,0
Tried to add hotels and truck stops won't let me,4
Why did you take scale icon off on last update. This was a very useful tool. Don't care much the new version.,1
Not worth my phone space.Didnt do anything it was designed to do,0
Won't work on Kyocera brigader,0
Open when is really closed....and closed when it is really open. We need a better app.,0
Doesn't give truck routes.  Might as well use Google,1
Worst app its not accurate on 80℅ try to correct does not work,0
Have they solved the problem with the push notification that went out to thousands of users saying they were gonna call the law on them ? The one falsely claiming they gave out someone's phone number.,0
Haic,0
WTH did you do with the weigh station button??????,2
This app is useless after the update since you can no longer see weigh stations. Uninstalling.,2
This is a great app.  The idea of this was great i loved this app in the beginning.  But people are wrecking it by saying there is lots of parking spots available when there isnt any and with weigh stations saying they are open when closed or closed when they are open its to bad people have to wreck it like i said great app to use as a tool if people didnt have to mess around,4
"Installed it and nothing, typed in destination and absolutely nothing, sucks big time too bad can't give no stars",0
Does not give routes that trucks can take.,0
After the new update the routing is terrible. Please fix this,1
It doesnt put all truck stops on route when you have preferred fuel stops its important,2
"This F'n app sucks.  It doesn't speak to you, I can barely see where my location is. If I zoom in, ya caint even see a mile a head, and to top it off, If any of you go through Sumner and Tacoma Washington. Watch out because the truck rout or no truck over weight signs are placed so u caint see them until you commit to the turn. I got pulled over right after I committed. I had to continue instead of back up because of all the traffic.  Thank God he let me go.  Ya this app took me that jacked route!",0
"Bullshit,man update the adreses of the truck stops,  add the new weight station in Oklahoma, put truck stops for the New York state, it's plenty of them over there!!!!",2
Naz I don't like it cause after I installed it its stuck in downloading mode and I can't even give it a try help,0
Changing my rating because they keep bugging me to Rate their app even though I did over a year ago,0
"You really need to require people to sign in to write location reviews, and if they get too many complaints about language, their phone gets blocked from writing more site reviews. It really makes your app, and its data look like its maintained by amateurs.",0
It's the best in the future of this message was delivered to your website and the other side of things,0
Didn't work,0
Weigh station open/close is WRONG,2
DOT uses this app to keep scales closed when actually opened to confuse and trick drivers.  I have seen this in person.  This app is unreliable for scales.,0
App was worth 5 stars but now just crashes and the scale comments Never update they are 100+ days old,0
Checking this app and route I know and it's sending me to Parkway and low bridges a complete waste of time buy a truck GPS and save yourself tickets from police,1
To many bugs especially when trying to live coment on scale status.,0
It would be much more helpful if the GPS understood where commercial vehicles weren't allowed,0
Kool,0
"Deleted last appreciation,was remiss in awarding 2*.app is quite infuriating if 1 is a 48 state driver.regional or dedicateds probably love it.literally want 2 spike device of Hwy surface @ speed when trying 2 make use of programs",0
They give me car routes.,0
Horrible route planner.,0
u wouldnt stop asking me to rate u,0
Get my name rite,0
This saved me so much time can't go without it,0
Driver,0
No love's truckstops,0
Not sure yet,0
"If you're a rookie driver that hasnt been out here that long you need to just stick with your google map on your smart phone. just type in what you're looking for on that and you'll be fine. do not rely on this app for accurate info. this app allows the public users to say whether or not a parking spot is full or empty, a weigh station is open or closed. a simple google search of weigh stations in the state you're in will give u accurate info on it. Dont rely on this app, Truck drivers lie all the time.",2
It sucks,0
Great app other than grown men/women telling lies about scales and parking. If people would be honest it's a great app,4
Didn't work at all took me off at an exit with a 13.0 clearance then it was trying to take down a max weight 5 ton route .... Hell no I'm not even going for the 3rd strike I'm out !!!! Very disappointed,0
It wouldn't install still won't install,0
"Not current on scale, open ,close",0
No milage to destination or turn by turn navigation,0
Somewhat accurate on t/s,0
"While I switched to my new cellphone, I installed the previous version of TPP, it worked flawlessly!  BUT after this update, the app kept crashing after tapped the icon.  No map was loaded or shown, let alone facilities locations.  Please fix it!",3
Looks like it could be a great tool for mmy drivers but every time I try to open it I get an error message telling me it has stopped working! I'm trying to use it on my Note 3,0
Used to  be a great app since the upgrade it no longer  works shame too I used it alot.,4
Stay off my phone!!!! Accused of doing something that I have not done with any app or my phone. If TP wants to accuse someone of somethimg they had better be right when they do. You are uninstalled. I can assure you my first impressions of TP will be lasting ones.,0
"Although the program is good, I got a message from TP that threatened me with repercussions for something I supposedly posted. I've never posted to this site except for weigh station statuses. A message from the Admin states a ""push message"" was sent out in error.  Bull! I can do without such childish antics...",2
"I installed the app as a backup. I use a Rand gps day to day and I got a notification from them that I have violated their terms of service???? I've NEVER USED IT....  Well, all I can say is YOU violated MY terms of acceptance. SCREW YOU. We put up with ENOUGH crap without more of yours puled on...",0
"I received a message stating I supposedly made a review posting someone else's phone number and threats that legal action could follow and my account deleted?  That's awesome! Press your charges I dare you, as for deleting my account no need your app will be deleted, I have no time for non sense apps",0
Any app that sends me threatening messages for no reason will be deleted. Get your programming straight before you push an app on Google. This is total bull accident or not.,0
Contacted me today. Making accusations that I disclose third party information about somebody. And threaten saying that they were going to delete me that it was against their policy. That this was against Privacy Acts or something. Sorry don't need this kind of BS from an app. Only try this app one time never got to use it. Sorry not for me. Sounds like this app has bad security measures. Uninstalled it right a way.,2
"Sending me messages, making serious accusations, and then claiming they were ""an error"" in order to force me to rate this app is a cheap, lousy trick  from what has been a solid, mostly dependable app. Time to fire whoever is in charge of notification push. I dislike being accused of anything I didn't do, even in error.  EDIT: Uninstalling. Not only did the message attempt to force a rating, the scripts on this page would not let me opt out of ""inviting"" other truckers... not a chance, now.",0
I received a notification saying that I posted phone numbers I can only imagine that your system was probably hacked and people are able to send push notifications to my telephone therefore I will be deleting this app and I encourage everyone else not to install it and if you have it installed I would suggest deleting it because I know that I don't want my phones security compromised it is obvious that their system has a ton of security loopholes,0
Just got a message saying i posted someone's number illegally or something tgen got a message saying sorry for the error....you wont send me another one cause you're deleted as of now,0
Got message from them saying I deleted information and gave out a phone number and next time I'd be turned in to higher authorities and be kicked out so I kicked my self out its was all b.s. I don't need this,2
"got notified I posted someone's info on a wall, I do NOT tolerate this from anyone, and refuse to have you accuse me of something I never did.  am uninstalling app immediately!!!",0
To be accused of miss use and sharing private information. I don't need this.,2
"I've never used this app and I received a message saying I violated their terms, way to go.",0
I got a message saying that I posted something and i never used the app,0
Got massage says I post some body's info that's bullshit I am going to remove this app,0
"Don't need the hassle.  Got a notice I gave a bad review of a truck stop and if I did it again, they would contact the 'authorities' ?? I never have given any review ....except this one!!!",2
Same complaint as everyone else,0
They don't make sure they fact check...told me I gave out someone personal INFO out.....don't know how to do that....don't know what they was talking about....deleted app forever,0
Today received  a message from the truckerpath team saying i disclosed someone's personal information. They further threatened to refer me to higher authorities. Thing i never done and already uninstall the app.,0
They said I gave out info also so I'm going to uninstall also,0
I got a message from them saying I posted some private info on a user and they threatened to call the police. I have NEVER made any posts on their app period. When an app threatens it'd users and does so falsely its time to warn people,0
Saying  I posted some bad stuff and I haven't used yet!!!,0
I never give out personal information and to be told I did it is wrong,0
Got message from this apt that I posted third-party  info never posted anything  here before today liked there threat of them contacting higher  authority,0
Liked it until bs message saying I violated rules by posting someone's phone number.,0
I haven't used this app in weeks and don't appreciate the message I got from the app saying I disclosed some ones location and broke the law.  I did no such thing and will be uninstalling this app.  Highly irresponsible.,0
Opens this app 1 time last week never posted anything . They sent me notice of violation for posting someone personal info. Then I looked at others reviews they had same thing sent to them . Deleting app!!!,0
I used to really like this app until they threatened to report me to higher authorities for a review I never wrote. Deleted it immediately.,0
I received and message saying I had posted a  negative message and I have never posted anything I think I you were trying to reach someone else but anywho I am deleting this app from my phone I don’t use it anyway. Next time get your facts right before you accuse someone of something.,0
Uninstalling. Got a message saying that i posted someones info on a restroom wall. Ive never even used this app. Claiming if they see me doing it again thet are contacting tge authorities? For what?lol uninstalled!,0
They said i had written a review posting someone's personal information and i had never even written a review. Idiots,0
"Just like a couple other peole said here, I also receved a notification that I disclosed someone's personal information in the review I posted. And notification also threatned that higher authorities will be notified. The fact is I did never leave a review on this app, haven't really used it since I downloaded it. Because of that I do not recommend this app",0
This site said I did something I didn't do. Saying they would send the authorities at me for something I don't know I said. I don't even use this site.,2
I was just accused by these people for giving out third party information in someone elses phone number I did nothing of the sort against the federal government I contacted my lawyer and he is looking into it I also deleted the app,0
"I got a message saying I disclosed someone's personal info. I didn't do anything of the sort.  If I have to delete this app  I will. I use it all the time. Everyday!!!        Also, too many people MESS with the truck parking levels. They say a place is FULL when it's NOT!! I know theirs no way to control any of that mess. But, I use this app as a resource everyday.",1
"Uninstalled it just now. Got a message I disclosed someone's personal info and if it happened again they would report me to higher authorities. Guess what, there won't be a next time. Just Uninstalled it!!! Besides my trucker gps shows me everything. Thanks for the threat",0
"Sorry fellow drivers, tried to add to the usefulness of this app by posting info for a south Florida motel with PLENTY of truck parking that wasn't listed. Got a notification threatening to ""notify authorities"" for posting uh, ""private info"" (meaning I entered the motel's phone number into the field provided). Screw this app. Deleted.",0
I received a message from the app saying I had posted reviews of stops with personal information including phone numbers. Then threatened me with prosecution. I do not recall ever posting a review and I have never posted personal information. Uninstalled it - dont like bogus threats.,0
"Isnt useful at all, havent used it in over a month, forgot i even had it, until they started sending me wild accusations, and threats!!!",0
You send me a message saying I violated a law or some other crap I have no clue what you are talking about I took care of the problem you are deleted  an I will make sure all my trucker friends do the same,0
They sent me a message saying I post peoples names and phone numbers and might be reported for this I haven't Evan used this app yet and now I won't. Don't use it. Some kind of scam.,4
the app sent me a message saying i posted personal information on the app never used the app once deleted this app.,0
"Just received a notice that some reviews I made were deemed inappropriate and were deleted. Also warned that if I post inappropriate reviews again the authorities would be contacted.  Problem is though I downloaded the app, I've never used it and I've never posted any reviews.  So here is an official review. I have now deleted this app.",0
Started out good then got a message that I posted someone's personal info and told if it happens again there gonna call the police.I never posted anything.So beware,0
Will not let me register,0
Said I was given out personal information on some reviews I never made any reviews on any place or anyone deleting app never to use or trust again,1
"Doesn't work. Received a bogus text saying I posted someone's personal info. I tried to use the app one time several months ago. The app is crap. If I am threatened again, I WILL talk to my attorney.",0
It said I was sending info to a third party and I wasn't using it. I uninstalled it.,0
"Don't submit any reviews. I submitted reviews, used my own phone number and was told I violated some dumb third party law..Really??? 1 ★ rating and uninstalled. App wasn't worth a crap anyways. My GPS does way more.",0
I don't appreciate random messages accusing me of posting someone's personal information at a truck stop I've never visited and threatening to sick the authorities on me.,0
No good,0
Was just notified that I posted someone 's personal information on here. I have never used this since downloaded it on my phone.  I did not do that and never would!  So I will be taking this app off of my phone now!,0
"I'm being accused of doing something on your app that I have no clue of what you are talking about,so what I'm gonna do is delete your app from my phone",0
I left a bad review and they threatened me with going to the higher authorities for a violation,0
This app sucks might as well use Google maps!,1
Please fix and allow use of 3rd party gps apps as an option when I click directions! Can not rely on Google maps to legally and safely route a semi truck.,1
"GPS does not work, puts my location 5 blocks away. Useless app",0
"Just did a routing from Gary, IN, to my house in Georgia.  If I was a bird I could follow the route.  I think I'll stick with using a regular map/atlas.",0
Sucks balls,0
Don't understand it and it won't start.i guess I need to play with it some more.,0
Used it 2 times both times it sent me down a no truck route.  It should be called path pro then instead of trucker path pro but thanks for your reply and possibly causing major problems.,4
Toyota Avalon,0
App is junk does not give you and exit ramp eta you have to manually zoom in on the screen and move it while you drive if that's not bad enough when you try to follow the route will stop and ask you to update parking and you drive by,0
Driver @ Landstar,0
It won't down load on my phone,0
"When I first began using the app I could leave reviews on places with no problem, you seemed to have fixed it... why can't I leave reviews?  I addressed this issue before, ya'all said it was fixed...  again today want to leave a review app will not post it.  .....  ☆☆☆ If you can read my rating on this app I had a data connection!  Anytime I want to leave a less than stellar review it will not allow it. Hmm... so are the reviews truly REAL reviews?",1
I was off the road for 6 months. I reinstalled it the other day.  Now I have malware popups. Had to delete it.,0
"The app is unsafe for truck driver , it just routed  me on a Parkway on Long Island ,NY. Thankfully I knew trucks can't go on Parkway's",2
"This would be a nice app if it wasn't for all the attempts to get me to do their job for them.  I am not your marketing department,  nor do you pay me what an advertisement agency gets.  When you pay me several thousand dollars a month  then I will do your marketing and sales for you. Until then STOP ASKING ME TO DO YOUR ADVERTISING.   A good app doesn't need to beg its users to send it to others yet I can't do anything without it asking me to  send it to others so the can get the same  spam notices.",3
Always crashes after I close out and try to go back in.,0
Always brings me to last location and I have manually find where I am. Uninstalling!,0
Keeps asking me to refer friends. Very annoying.,0
It's an amazing app but it crashes constantly. It forced closed 7times in 10 minutes today,0
"It clearly says gps navigation, this app sucks. Don't download",0
wont prepare a route drive the same routes for years but yet app tells me the route is impossible,0
How do you use the gps. I want to put a route in but idk how to start the route,0
"Fix the search feature, it was perfect before, now you guys messed it up...if I search a city and state, I want to see what's in that area...that's it!!!",0
Ot,0
Can't get it to download been trying for two days,0
I've tried to download this app many times on my data and wi-firewatch and it never downloads.,0
Old app was ten times better. Bring it back!!!!,0
Not helpful at all.  States that a weigh station is closed when it's open and has no setting for preferences.,2
App sucks for GPS,0
Won't download at all. I've got enough apps already.,0
it feeds you wrong information I don't need an app like that.,2
This update socks.,0
App won't download made several attempts gave up,4
Keeps crashing,0
Not happy. Please return prev. vers. I like off line work.,0
Sucks never can even bring up map,0
"""Routes are not optimized for trucks.""  So it's useless to it's target audience.",0
Loved this app but something happened to it. I'm in St Joseph Missouri and it says I'm in Chicago. I update my location and it still says Chicago.,0
This app is a joke,0
It won't even download for me,0
Previous version was way better,0
The most useful part of this app has been removed and if it is not brought back the app will be removed.. and I will use the byways scale pre pass app for free...This app is just useless without the history,2
The app is great and is the best trip planner app up until a couple hours ago the app stopped working and it keeps telling me I have network problems on 4glte and WiFi. I just tried to email the creator about it and I got an email saying that the admin email they use is a non working domain,0
I can't do anything with this app because it keeps force closing. Need you to fix asap,3
